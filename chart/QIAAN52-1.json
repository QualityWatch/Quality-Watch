In 2011, this question was only answered by respondents who were attending their first appointment at the outpatients department. The results, therefore, are not directly comparable with earlier years, where respondents were included irrespective of it being their first appointment or not. <br><br>The proportion of patients who reported waiting less than six weeks to get an outpatients appointment rose substantially from 57% in 2004 to 73% in 2009. In 2009, 17% of patients waited between six weeks and three months; 9% waited between three and 12 months; and 1% waited over a year, but less than 18 months. These proportions had all decreased since 2004.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Outpatient Services"}
