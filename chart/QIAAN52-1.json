"analysis_commentary" : "<P>In 2011, 49% of those who attended the outpatient department for the first time waited one month or less for an appointment. 93% of patients waited less than three months and approximately six per cent waited for more than three months. In 2011, this question was only answered by respondents who were attending their first appointment at the outpatients department. The results, therefore, are not directly comparable with 2004 or 2009, where responses were included from all respondents irrespective of it being their first appointment or not. The proportion of patients who reported waiting less than six weeks to get an outpatients appointment rose substantially from 57% in 2004 to 73% in 2009. In 2009, 17% of patients waited between six weeks and three months; 9% waited between three and 12 months; and 1% waited over a year, but less than 18 months. These proportions had all decreased since 2004.</P>",
