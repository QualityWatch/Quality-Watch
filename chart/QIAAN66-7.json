However, certain people are more likely to develop potentially serious complications of flu, such as bronchitis and pneumonia. The injected flu vaccine is therefore offered to people who are at risk to ensure that they are protected against catching flu and developing serious complications. Influenza immunisation has been recommended in the UK since the late 1960s, with the aim of directly protecting those in clinical risk groups who are at a higher risk of influenza associated morbidity and mortality. In 2000, the policy was extended to include all people aged 65 years or over. In 2010, pregnancy was added as a clinical risk category for routine influenza immunisation. In 2012 it was recommended that the programme should be extended to all children aged two to 16 years. The overall trend for the coverage of individuals aged over 65 receiving the influenza vaccination remains fairly static at between 71% and 75% over the time period recorded.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Public Health England, Seasonal flu vaccine uptake <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/collections\/vaccine-uptake>"}
