The hospital admission rate in the UK for short- and long-term diabetes complications and uncontrolled diabetes without complications has been stable since 2006, with approximately 73 admissions per 100,000 population in 2011  â€“ one of the lowest rates among the comparator countries. Both Italy and the Netherlands had lower rates of admission than the UK, with France having the lowest. Despite lower hospital admissions, the estimated prevalence of diabetes in 2014 was higher in France (7.17 per cent) than in the UK (5.38 per cent) (International Diabetes Federation, 2014). Ideally, we would like to measure hospital admissions within the diabetes population rather than the general population. While hospital admission rates have been stable in the UK, many adults but especially children still do not receive the recommended care for diabetes (Health and Social Care Information Centre, 2014; Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 2015) and there are large variations around Europe in the quality of care provided and diabetes outcomes (e.g. HbA1c control) (see the SWEET project: www.sweet-project.eu\/relaunch\/). <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
