The hospital admission rate in the UK for short- and long-term diabetes complications and uncontrolled diabetes without complications was stable between 2011 (66.3 admissions per 100,000) and 2013 (64.3 admissions per 100,000) one of the lowest rates among the comparator countries.<br><br>Both Italy and the Spain had lower rates of admission than the UK, with Italy having the lowest in 2013 (43.5 per 100,000). Despite lower hospital admissions, the estimated prevalence of diabetes in 2014 was higher in Spain(6.8%) than in the UK (5.8%) (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.oecd-ilibrary.org\/docserver\/download\/8116231ec018.pdf?expires=1498489063&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=B90D8ADD7C6D3E1CA817BFCEA4C74428\">OECD, Diabetes prevalence 2016<\/a>). Ideally, we would like to measure hospital admissions within the diabetes population rather than the general population. Whilst hospital admission rates have been stable in the UK, many adults, but especially children, still do not receive the recommended care for diabetes  Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, 2015) and there are large variations around Europe in the quality of care provided and diabetes outcomes (e.g. HbA1c control) (see <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sweet-project.eu\">SWEET project.<\/a><br><br>Updated June 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/stats.oecd.org\/\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data<\/a>"}
