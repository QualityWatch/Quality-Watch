","analysis_commentary" : "<P>In 2010, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/213804\/dh_122393.pdf\">Next steps for the Carers Strategy<\/a> set out aims for carers to have a life of their own alongside their caring role, for them to be supported so that they are not forced into financial hardship, and for them to be supported to stay mentally and physically well. To assess whether these outcomes are being met, we can look at carer-reported quality of life scores based on responses to the Survey of Adult Carers in England. For details on how this score is calculated please see 'about this data' below.<br><br>Between 2012-13 and 2016-17, average carer-reported quality of life scores decreased in all regions of the country. In England, quality of life scores decreased from 8.1 in 2012-13 to 7.7 in 2016-17. There is also regional variation in carer-reported quality of life scores. In 2016-17, the North East reported the highest quality of life scores (8.3) and the East Midlands reported the worst (7.5). Male carers had an average score of 7.9 in England, which is 0.3 points higher than females who scored 7.6 (data not shown).<br><br>Updated January 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB30122\">NHS Digital, Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework<\/a>"}
