To explore whether this is happening, we can look at carer-reported quality of life using the Survey of Adult Carers. For details on how this score is calculated please see 'about this data' below. <br><br>The average carer-reported quality of life score has decreased slightly across the country from 8.1 in 2012-13 to 7.9 in 2015-16. There is regional variation in the reported quality of life score. In 2015-16, the North East reported the highest quality of life scores (8.5) and London the worst (7.6). Male carers had an average score of 8.1 in England, which is 0.3 points higher than females who scored 7.8 (data not shown). <br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework<\/a><br>"}
