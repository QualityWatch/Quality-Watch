To explore if this happening, we can look at carer-reported quality of life using the Survey of Adult Carers (for details on how this score is calculated please see 'about this data' below).<br><br>Here, a higher score represents a higher quality of life, with 12 being the maximum. In England, in 2012-13 we can see that the average score of 8.1 is well above the halfway mark of 6 and shows that there is a reasonably high quality of life among carers in that year. Males have the highest score of 8.3, which is 0.3 higher than females who score 8.0. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England"}
