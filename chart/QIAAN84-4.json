Delays in transfer from acute care and non-acute care were very similar in August 2010, but from that point onwards the total number of days delayed accrued in a month in acute and non-acute care have diverged from one another. The number of days delayed per month in acute care increased by 117% between January 2011 (60,125 days) and January 2017 (130,422 days). The number of days delayed per month in non-acute care has decreased by 23% between Janaury 2011 (54,221 days) and January 2017 (66,632 days).<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
