Delays in transfer from acute care and non-acute care were very similar in August 2010, however, from that point onwards the total number of days delayed accrued in a month have diverged between the care settings. The number of days delayed per month in acute care has increased by 82 per cent between August 2010 (55,332 days) and December 2015 (100,493 days). The number of days delayed per month in non-acute care has decreased by 2 per cent between August 2010 (54,586 days) and December 2015 (53,567 days).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
