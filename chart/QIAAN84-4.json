Delays in transfer from acute care and non-acute care were very similar in August 2010, however, from that point onwards the total number of days delayed accrued in a month have diverged between the care settings. The number of days delayed per month in acute care has increased by approximately 24% between August 2010 (55,332 days) and July 2013 (68,648 days). The number of days delayed per month in non-acute care has decreased by approximately 20% between August 2010 (54,586 days) and July 2013 (43,635 days).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Delayed transfer of care"}
