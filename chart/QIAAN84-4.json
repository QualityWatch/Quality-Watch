Delays in transfer from acute care and non-acute care were very similar in August 2010, but from that point onwards the total number of days delayed accrued in a month in acute and non-acute care have diverged from one another. The number of days delayed per month in acute care increased by 98% between April 2011 (58,407 days) and April 2017 (115,554 days). The number of days delayed per month in non-acute care has decreased by 24% between April 2011 (49,657 days) and April 2017 (61,583 days).<br><br>Updated July 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/delayed-transfers-of-care-data-2017-18\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
