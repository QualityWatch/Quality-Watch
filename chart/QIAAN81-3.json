This can also be seen in terms of the total number of people waiting, which fell to a low of almost 400,000 in December 2008. Since then, the list has been steadily increasing and in July 2014 was over 870,000, surpassing the highs seen in 2006. This should be seen in the context of rapidly increasing number of diagnostic tests undertaken each month: 816k in January 2006, and 1.7m in January 2016 (data not shown). <br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/monthly-diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
