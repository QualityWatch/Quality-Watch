In December 2008, the waiting list fell to a low of just over 400,000 people. Since then, the list has been steadily increasing and in February 2018 over 943,000 people were waiting for a diagnostic test. This should be seen in the context of a rapid increase in the number of diagnostic tests being undertaken; there were 902,000 diagnostic tests in February 2007 compared to 1.7 million in February 2018, an increase of over 90%.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
