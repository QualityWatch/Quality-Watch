These targets are that: 90% of admitted people should be treated within 18 weeks, 95% for non-admitted people and 92% for incomplete pathways. <br><br>We are particularly interested in the pattern for waiting times for people on non-admitted pathways which we noted earlier has seen an increase in median wait times. We can see that the proportion treated within 18 weeks has fallen slightly. It does not appear that simply a shift in focus of trusts to reduce the number of 'those waiting longest' (more than 18 or 52 weeks) fully accounts for the increase in the median wait time for non-admitted pathways. While this median is in not in danger of breaching targets in the near future, if the trend continues there could be problems down the line. <br><br>We also know that in April 2013, non-consultant led sexual health treatments no longer had to report against the 18-week target and so are no longer included in the data shown. It is likely that the removal of these contribute to some of the increase we see here for non-admitted pathways, however there is no data available to explore this.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
