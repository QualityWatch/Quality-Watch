These targets are that: 90% of admitted people should be treated within 18 weeks, 95% for non-admitted people and 92% for incomplete pathways. <br><br>For the first time since March 2011 a waiting time target was breached. In February 2014, the proportion of admitted referrals treated in less than 18 weeks fell below 90% and this trend continued to a low of 89.4% in March 2014. Since then it has remained at or below 90%. Looking at the pattern of waiting times for people on non-admitted pathways and incomplete pathways we can see that the proportion treated within 18 weeks has been decreasing for both however neither of these measures have breached their targets.<br><br>It does not appear that simply a shift in focus of trusts to reduce the number of 'those waiting longest' (more than 18 or 52 weeks) fully accounts for the increase in the median wait times we've seen. Rather it seems that a general increase in number of people waiting for treatment has also contributed.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
