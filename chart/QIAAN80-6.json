These targets are that: 90% of admitted people should be treated within 18 weeks, 95% for non-admitted people and 92% for incomplete pathways. <br><br>For the first time since March 2011 a waiting target was breached. In February 2014, the proportion of admitted referrals who were treated in less than 18 weeks went below 90% to 89.9%, this trend continued in March 2014 (89.4%). Looking at the pattern of waiting times for people on non-admitted pathways we can see that the proportion treated within 18 weeks has fallen slightly.<br><br>It does not appear that simply a shift in focus of trusts to reduce the number of 'those waiting longest' (more than 18 or 52 weeks) fully accounts for the increase in the median wait times we've seen.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
