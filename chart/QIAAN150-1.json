Although this rate has been climbing for many years, this increase is slight and appears to have slowed recently. In the period between April 2006 and March 2010, falls increased by nine admissions per 100,000 per year, whereas in the period between April 2010 and December 2013, the rates increased by one admission per 100,000 per year.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
