Since 2008\/09, there has been a 23% increase in the number of transplants from deceased donors, which was partly due to transplants after circulatory death becoming more common. Transplants from living donors increased by 12% in the same period, and in 2012 this represented one third of all kidney transplants.  Most are donated to a specific recipient known to the donor – typically a close family member or friend – but there have been notable increases in the number of altruistic donations (a person offers to donate to someone who needs a transplant but whom they have not known previously) and paired exchange living donations. The increasing number of transplants means that the number of patients on the national list for a kidney transplant has been falling since 2008.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS Blood and Transplant"}
