In the UK it fell from 26.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2001 to 22.9 deaths per 100,000 population in 2010 and the UKâ€™s performance on this indicator lies in between the comparator countries. Greece, which has the lowest mortality rates of the comparator countries (17.1 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011), had an incidence rate of 13.5 per 100,000 population in 2012 while incidence in the UK was more than double in the same year, with 30.2 per 100,000 population. It is also interesting to note that Australia has one of the lowest mortality rates (19 deaths per 100,000 population in 2011), but one of the highest incidence rates (38.4 per 100,000 in 2012) relative to the other comparator countries. Mexico had the lowest mortality rate of all the OECD countries with 7.7 deaths per 100,000 population in 2012. <br><br>For more information see our indicators on cancer screening and survival.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
