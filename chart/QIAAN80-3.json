The proportion of patients with an incomplete pathway waiting over 52 weeks has been falling steadily and has been below 0.05% since October 2012. We do see however an increase in the proportion of admitted pathways waiting more than 52 weeks since January 2014 - it was 0.09% in March 2014. There has been no noticeable effect on this trend from the introduction of the 'zero-tolerance' policy introduced in April 2013. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : ""}
