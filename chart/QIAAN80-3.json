In 2008, the 18-week target was introduced, however, the 95th percentile has never moved below 19.3 weeks. The 95th percentile from referral to treatment for incomplete pathways has decreased over time and, since August 2012, has levelled at about 18.6 weeks. For non-admitted people, the long-term trend shows the 95th percentile has been decreasing overall and has always been below 18 weeks since the target was introduced. </P>",
