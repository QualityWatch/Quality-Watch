The proportion of patients with an incomplete pathway waiting over 52 weeks has been falling steadily and has been below 0.05% since October 2012. There has been no noticeable effect on this trend from the introduction of the 'zero-tolerance' policy introduced in April 2013. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
