The most improvement following surgery can be seen for patients who undergo hip replacements (an average 87% between 2009\/2010 and 2011\/2012), followed by knee replacements (an average 78% between 2009\/2010 and 2011\/2012). For groin hernia and varicose vein operations only slightly more than 50% of patients reported an improvement yet the other 50% reported no change or deterioration. Following feedback from PROMs users, from 2012 there was a change in the methodology for hip and knee replacement operations which are now recorded to distinguish between primary or revision operations. Thus now it is possible to see that there tends to be less improvement following revision operations for both knee and hip replacement.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Health & Social Care Information Centre"}
