According to the limited amount of data available for previous years, there appears to be a marginal inverse relationship between the total number of calls and the percentage that can be responded to within the eight minutes.<br><br>This chart and those discussed above indicate that the total number of calls is not the sole reason for below target performance in a given month. Breaches are not always associated with increased call activity and increased call activity doesn't always result in a breach. To better understand this issue further investigation of potential causes would be needed.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
