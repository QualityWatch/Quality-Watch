However, the total number of calls doesn't appear to be the sole reason for the breach of the national standard in a given month as breaches are not always associated with increased call activity and increased call activity doesn't always result in a breach.<br><br>Further investigation of what is happening to cause breaches would be needed and is not down solely to activity in response to ambulance calls that are classed as life threatening.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
