This can include the types of care services provided, how much care provision there is and information on the workforce. For more information on this data please see 'about this data' below. Here we only look at data on staff employed (directly and indirectly) by adult social services departments in England. The data do not include information on privately funded social care, or children's social services. <br><br>The median number of sickness days has varied little and has genrally been 1 day every year since 2011, except for 2013 when it reached 1.5 days. We see that the average (mean) number of sickness days per employee is a lot higher than the median. This is likely due to a small group of employees taking a large number of sickness days; we will see how this varies in the next chart. Similar to the median number of sick days, the mean number of sick days increased in 2013 to 10.3 days but fell the following year. The average number of sick days in 2016 was 10.5 days.<br><br>Updated April 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/article\/2021\/Website-Search?productid=24375&q=Personal+Social+Services+&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1&area=both#top\">NHS Digital, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments<\/a>"}
