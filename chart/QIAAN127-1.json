This can include the types of care services provided, how much care provision there is and information on the workforce. For more information on this data please see 'about this data' below. Here we only look at data on staff (directly and indirectly) employed by adult social services departments in England only. The data does not include information on privately funded social care, or children's social services. <br><br>The median number of sickness days increases over the three years, from 1.0 in 2011 and 2012 to 1.5 in 2013. We see that the average (mean) number of sickness days per employee is a lot higher than the median. This will be due to a small group of employees taking a large number of sickness days; we will see how this varies in the next chart. The mean number of sickness days per employee has again increased over the three years; this was 9.7 in 2011 and 10.3 in 2013; this was an increase of 0.6 days. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments"}
