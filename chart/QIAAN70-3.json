Other outcomes include: declining or dropping out of treatment, being referred to another service, not being suitable for IAPT treatments or dying before they reach an outcome. The number of people successfully finishing a course of treatment has generally increased over time. In 2014-15 Q2 this was 114,697, roughly 40,000 more than 2011-12 Q1.<br><br>The proportion of finished treatments that showed reliable improvement, which means they achieved significant improvements in their symptoms but they did not achieve the technical definition of recovery (shown later) has increased slightly over time. Data on reliable recovery started collection in 2013-14 Q1, at this time it was 58.1%. By 2014-15 Q2 this had increased slightly to 61.3%.
