It is interesting to note that using this measure, for all four conditions patients consistently report less improvement with the operations. However, the greatest benefit from surgery can again be seen for hip replacement primary (an average 62% in the first three years) , followed by knee replacement (an average 51% in the first three years) and then varicose veins (a five-year average of 41%) and groin hernia (a five-year average of 38%) operations. Again it can be seen that a primary hip or knee replacement is more beneficial than a revision.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Health & Social Care Information Centre"}
