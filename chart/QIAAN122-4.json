The disease has a higher prevalence in America and Europe compared to Asia, however in countries where people are adopting western diets, such as Japan, the incidence of colon cancer is increasing. There are multiple screening methods available including the faecal occult blood test, colonoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Advances in diagnosis and treatment of colon cancer have led to increased survival over the last decade.<br><br>While the five-year colon cancer survival rate in the UK has been increasing over time, in 2010-2014 survival reached only 60%. This is the lowest five-year survival rate out of the 18 OECD countries that we included. Over the same time period in Australia it was as high as 70.6%, and Belgium and Japan reached a five-year colon cancer survival of 67.8%.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/stats.oecd.org\/\/Index.aspx?QueryId=51882\">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Care Quality Indicators, Cancer Care<\/a>"}
