The NICE quality statement states that patients with stroke are offered a minimum of 45 minutes of each active therapy that is required, for a minimum of 5 days a week, at a level that enables the patient to meet their rehabilitation goals for as long as they are continuing to benefit from the therapy and are able to tolerate it. <br><br>Here we look at performance of occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech & language therapy separately. Although there is no measure to look at these combined to accurately assess performance against the quality standard, these three measures can be used as a proxy. Overall, performance for speech & language therapy is lower compared to physiotherapy and occupational therapy; this is an average of 32.0% compared to an average of 65.3% for physiotherapy and 68.1% for occupational therapy. All measures increased performance over time, with the biggest improvement seen in occupational therapy which increased by 19.4% in the year. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Royal College of Physicians, Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP)"}
