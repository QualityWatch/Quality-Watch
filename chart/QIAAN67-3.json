The NICE quality statement states that patients with stroke are offered a minimum of 45 minutes of each active therapy that is required, for a minimum of five days a week, at a level that enables the patient to meet their rehabilitation goals for as long as they are continuing to benefit from the therapy and are able to tolerate it. <br><br>Here we look at performance of occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy separately. Although there is no measure to look at these combined to accurately assess performance against the quality standard, these three measures can be used as a proxy.  Overall, performance for speech and language therapy is lower compared to physiotherapy and occupational therapy. In 2015\/16, it was 41.6% compared with 73.5% for physiotherapy and 79.6% for occupational therapy. All measures increased performance over time, with the biggest improvement seen in occupational therapy, which increased by 23.8 percentage points since 2013\/14.<br><br>Updated August 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.strokeaudit.org\/results\/Clinical-audit\/National-Results.aspx\">Royal College of Physicians, Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP)<\/a>"}
