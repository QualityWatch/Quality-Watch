Achievement of the 75% response target has declined over this period, which might indicate a link. For example, the sudden drop in performance in December 2014 and March 2016 were accompanied by a spike in activity during those same months. However, not all months experiencing falls in performance are associated with any sudden increase in call volumes. This suggests other factors are also influencing the ability of ambulances to meet their target of attending 75% of category A calls with 8 minutes.<br><br>Please note that data has not been analysed from April 2016 onwards. This is because as part of the Ambulance Response Programme several Ambulance Trusts took part in pilots which introduced new categories of calls, which are not comparable to Category A (Red 1 and Red 2) and so the number of Category A calls decreases as data collection for Category A calls ceased in those Trusts.
