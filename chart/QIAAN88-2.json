Achievement of the 75% respsonse target has declined over this period, which might indicate a link. For example, the sudden drop in performance in December 2014 and March 2016 were accompanied by a spike in activity during those same months. However, not all months experiencing falls in performance are associated with any sudden increase in call volumes. This suggests other factors are also influencing the ability of ambulances to meet their target of attending 75% of category A calls with 8 minutes.<br><br>Note that the number of trusts included in the data fell by two in May 2016 and another one dropped off in July 2016, as these three trusts are taking part in the Ambulance Response Programme coding trial - monthly number of calls are excluded here. <br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
