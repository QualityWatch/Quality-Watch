Achievement of the target has declined over this period, which might indicate a link. For example, the sudden drop in performance in December 2014 and March 2016 were accompanied by a spike in activity during those same months. However, not all months experiencing falls in performance are associated with any sudden increase in call volumes. This suggests other factors are also influencing the ability of ambulances to meet their target of attending 75% of category A calls with 8 minutes.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
