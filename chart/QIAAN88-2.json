Between 2010\/11 and 2011\/12, there was a slight decrease in the proportion of category A calls being responded to within 19 minutes; from 96.8% to 96.0%. There was one month (within the most recent 28 months) where the 95% target was not met (December 2012), with 94.6% of calls being responded to within 19 minutes. This is attributable to a single trust failing to reach the standard.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
