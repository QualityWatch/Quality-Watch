Achievement of the target has declined over this period, which might indicate a link. For example, the sudden drop in performance in December 2014 is accompanied by a spike in activity during the same month. However, not all months experiencing falls in performance are associated with any sudden increase in call volumes. This suggests other factors are also influencing the ability of ambulances to meet their target of attending 75% of category A calls with 8 minutes.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
