This means that 2012 onwards cannot be compared directly to previous years.<br><br>Over all the years measured, staff who are male, disabled or non-white reported experiencing more violence from other staff when directly compared to their opposites (female, non-disabled and white) and to the national averages (data not shown).<br><br>Ambulance staff reported experiencing more violence compared to the other sectors shown between 2004 and 2011, but when the question changed in 2012 the percentage was very similar to the national average. At the same point, staff from mental health & learning disability trusts  reported more violence compared to other sectors, but this has been reducing over the last four years.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
