Here we look at what proportion of people who use social care services found it easy to find information about services. <br><br>There are some difficulties in comparing data between years. In 2010-11, the data was unweighted so cannot be directly compared to future years and in 2012-13, data from the Carers Survey was also included. In 2010-11 and 2011-12 the measure includes only the proportion of users who found it easy to access information; in 2012-13 the measure is the average of the proportion of users and carers who found it easy to find information about services. Despite these differences, the proportion who found it easy to find information has generally been decreasing and when carers were included in 2012-13, this was at a low of 71.4%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Adult Social Care Survey"}
