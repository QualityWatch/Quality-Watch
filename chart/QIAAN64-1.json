Here we look at what proportion of people who use social care services found it easy to find information about services. Because of changes to methodology in 2014-15, data from that year onwards cannot be directly compared to previous years.  <br><br>In 2014-5, 74.5% of service users found it easy to access information about support while it was only 65.5% of carers. Similarly in 2015-16, 73.5% of respondents found it fairly or very easy to find information about services. The carers survey is only undertaken every second year, so there is no data on this for 2015\/16.<br><br>Updated October 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.content.digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB21900\">NHS Digital, Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework<\/a>"}
