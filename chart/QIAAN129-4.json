The data is split by IMD decile. As with hip replacements, the rates of directly standardised knee replacements have increased across all deprivation deciles between 2003 and 2013, with the same differentials in treatment rate observed across deprivation categories. The least deprived decile has consistently shown the lowest knee replacement rates and could indicate that these patients are choosing to have this procedure done privately, although this cannot be shown using the available data. However the total number of NHS funded knee replacements seem to have levelled off in 2007\/08.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
