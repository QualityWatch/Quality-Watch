Trends in employment in the general population showed a fall between 2007 and 2010, whereas employment of people with LTCs was broadly steady. This resulted in a narrowing of the gap between the two rates (from 15% in 2006 to 11% in 2010). Through 2011 both rates remained similar to 2010 levels. From mid-2013, employment has been increasing in both groups. This resulted in a the highest employment rate seen in people with LTCs in 2014\/15 Q4 of 60.5%. The gap between the two groups however has not decreased. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
