Trends in employment in the general population fell from 73% at the end of 2007 to 70% 2010, while employment of people with LTCs remained broadly steady. This resulted in a narrowing of the gap between the two rates (from 15% in 2006 to 11% in 2010). From mid-2013, employment increased in both groups, which resulted in the highest employment rate seen in people with LTCs in 2015\/16 Q4 of 61%. The gap between the two groups, however, has not decreased and remained at 13.3 percentage points in Q4 2015\/16. <br><br>Updated August 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/\">NHS Outcomes Framework, NHS Digital<\/a>"}
