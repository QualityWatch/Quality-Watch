Trends in employment in the general population showed a fall between 2007 and 2010, whereas employment of people with LTCs was broadly steady. This resulted in a narrowing of the gap between the two rates (from 15% in 2006 to 11% in 2010). Through 2011 both rates remained similar to 2010 levels.  However, from mid-2012 employment in the general population began to increase - a rise not reflected in employment rates for those with long-term conditions.  This resulted to an increase in the gap between the rates to 14% at 2013\/14 Q3.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
