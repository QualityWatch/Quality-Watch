Overall the absolute number of admissions for hip fractures per year increased by 15.5% during the analysis period, rising from 46,495 admissions in 2001\/02 to 53,694 admissions in 2010\/11. However the increase in the numbers of older people in the population meant that the change in standardised rates was less dramatic, and mainly seems to fluctuate over the analysis period. The stability of the age-standardised rates suggests that much of the increase in the absolute numbers is due to the increasing number of older people.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
