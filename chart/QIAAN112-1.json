Overall the absolute number of admissions for hip fractures per year increased by 17.9% during the analysis period, rising from 48,915 admissions in 2002\/03 to 57,668 admissions in 2014\/15. However the increase in the numbers of older people in the population meant that the change in standardised rates was less dramatic, and mainly seems to fluctuate over the analysis period. The stability of the age-standardised rates suggests that much of the increase in the absolute numbers is due to the increasing number of older people.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health and Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
