Unsurprisingly, success rates fall as age increases.  The smallest proportion of people at home after 91 days are in the oldest age group (85 and over). In 2015\/16, 82.0% of females 85 and over and 77.3% of males 85 and over were living at home 91 days after discharge. Considering all people aged 65 and over, we see higher success with these services for women compared to men. The proportion of women who received a reablement service who were still living at home 91 days after discharge was higher in each year compared to all males. <br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href = \"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=Community+Care+Statistics%2C+Social+Services+Activity%2C&area=&size=10&sort=Relevance#top\">NHS Digital, Community Care Statistics, Social Services Activity<\/a>"}
