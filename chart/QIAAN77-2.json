Unsurprisingly, success rates fall as age increases.  The smallest proportion of people at home after 91 days are the oldest (85 and over) who in 2013\/14 were at 82.1% (compared to total 84.3%) for females and 76.4% (compared to total 79.6%) for males. Considering all people aged 65 and over, we see higher success with these services for women compared to men. The proportion of women who received a reablement service who were still living at home 91 days after discharge was higher in each year compared to all males. In 2013\/14, this was 84.3% for females compared to 79.6% for males aged 65 and over.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Adult Social Care - Combined Activity Return (ASC-CAR)"}
