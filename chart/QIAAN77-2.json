Since 2011\/12, there have been higher rates of successful reablement for women compared to men. In 2016\/17, 83.9% of women aged 65 and over who received a reablement service were still living at home 91 days after discharge, compared to only 80.1% of men. Stratifying by age groups shows that success rates of reablement services fall as age increases. Reablement is least successful in the oldest age group (people aged 85 and over). In 2016\/17, 85.7% of people aged 65 to 74 who received a reablement service were still living at home 91 days after discharge, compared to only 80.3% of people aged 85 and over.<br><br>Updated December 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB30122\">NHS Digital, Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework<\/a>"}
