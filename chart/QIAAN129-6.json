The data is shown for 2012\/13 and excludes private treatment. Here we see a very different pattern to the other three sets of procedures, with the highest treatment rates being observed in the most deprived areas. Studies suggest a higher prevalence of cataracts in more deprived areas, which would explain these results as the need for treatment would be higher in these areas. The differences in treatment rate between the deprivation deciles has been consistent over the last ten years (data not shown). Once again lower treatment rates in the least deprived areas may be due to people being more likely to use privately funded care.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
