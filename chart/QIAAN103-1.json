The 'total time' is how long the patient spent in A&E from arrival to when the patient leaves the department - to be admitted, transferred or discharged. The period between January and April 2013 saw particularly high levels of patients waiting over four hours - was 5.07% of all emergency admissions, compared with an overall average of 2.22% for the preceding 26 months. The proportion waiting over four hours then dropped sharply after April 2013 (from May 2013 to May 2014), with an average of 3.07% of emergency admissions waiting over four hours for a bed.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
