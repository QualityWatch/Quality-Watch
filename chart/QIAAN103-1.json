The line on this chart shows the percentage of admitted patients who wait more than four hours between the decision to admit and admission. The percentage of people waiting more than four hours to arrive on a ward is highest in the winter months, but has clearly increased substantially since 2010. The chart also shows the number of people waiting more than 12 hours to arrive on a ward (columns). While this is very small in comparison to the total number of people using A&E, it is clear that a growing number of patients are waiting an extremely long time.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
