The chart shows the proportion of people undergoing surgery within 24 and 48 hours following admission for hip fracture. The trends for both measures  mirror each other closely, declining initially between 2001\/02 and 2005\/06 from 73.3% to 69.0% of patients operated on within 48 hours, but rising steadily after this and reaching a maximum in 2010\/11, with 83.2% of patients operated on within 48 hours of admission. The largest year-on-year increase occurred between 2009\/10 and 2010\/11, with the  proportion of patients operated on within 24 hours rising markedly from 58.7% to 67.0%, with a corresponding increase from 77.7% to 83.2% of patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
