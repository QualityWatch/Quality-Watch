The trends for both metrics mirror each other closely, declining initially between 2002\/03 and 2005\/06 from 71.4% to 69.0% of patients operated on within 48 hours, but rising steadily after this and reaching a maximum in 2014\/15, with 88.5% of patients operated on within 48 hours of admission. The largest year-on-year increase occurred between 2009\/10 and 2010\/11 with the proportion of patients operated on within 24 hours rising markedly from 58.7% to 67.0%, with a corresponding increase from 77.7% to 83.3% of patients undergoing surgery within 48 hours.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health and Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
