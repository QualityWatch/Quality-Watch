Direct care are however the largest staff group and make up over 50% of the workforce (data not shown). The biggest difference for the direct care group is the percentage of staff taking 'more than 40' sickness days; this was 7.6% in 2014 compared to 4.9% for managers, supervisors; 6.0% for professionals and 5.0% for other staff. This perhaps indicates that job roles which are directly involved in providing care and support, on average take more sickness days than those not directly involved, this was 10.8 days in 2014 compared to 9.5 for all job roles. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB16834\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments<\/a>"}
