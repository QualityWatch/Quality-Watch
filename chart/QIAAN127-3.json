The direct group also had a slightly larger percentage of staff taking '10.1 to 20' sickness days; this was 8.6% in 2013 compared to 6.1% for managers, supervisors. This perhaps indicates that job roles which are directly involved in providing care and support, on average take more sickness days than those not directly involved. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments"}
