Direct care is however the largest staff group and makes up over 50% of the workforce (data not shown). The biggest difference for the direct care group is the percentage of staff taking 'more than 40' sickness days; this was 9% in 2015 compared to 5% for managers and supervisors, 7% for professionals and 5% for other staff. This indicates that job roles that are directly involved in providing care and support take, on average, more sickness days than those not directly involved; this was 12.1 days in 2015 compared to 10.5 for all job roles.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB16834\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments<\/a>"}
