Direct care is however the largest staff group and makes up over 50% of the workforce (data not shown). The biggest difference for the direct care group is the percentage of staff taking 'more than 40' sickness days; this was 9% in 2015 compared to 5% for managers and supervisors, 7% for professionals and 5% for other staff. This indicates that job roles that are directly involved in providing care and support take, on average, more sickness days than those not directly involved; this was 12.1 days in 2015 compared to 10.5 for all job roles.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/article\/2021\/Website-Search?productid=20238&q=Personal+Social+Services+Staff+of+Social+Services&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1&area=both#top\">NHS Digital, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments<\/a>"}
