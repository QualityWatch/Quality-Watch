The proportion of service users who completed drug treatment free of dependency increased to 47% in 2011\/12, from 21% in 2005\/06. This was balanced by the decrease in the number of service users who had an incomplete treatment or unknown status at the point of discharge during the same period. The ability to compare 2009\/10 to 2010\/11 data to previous years was affected by changes in coding (see information in 'About this data'). This suggests that there was under coding for patients who were referred on\/transferred, as the proportion of those who were transferred (combining those in custody and those not) after 2009\/10 was approximately 10% higher than those referred before then.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Public Health England, Substance misuse"}
