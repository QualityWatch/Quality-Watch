"analysis_commentary" : "<P>Individuals who achieve completion of drug treatment demonstrate a significant improvement in health and wellbeing in terms of increased longevity, reduced blood-borne virus transmission, improved parenting skills and improved physical and psychological health. Alcohol consumption is a contributing factor to hospital admissions and deaths from a diverse range of conditions. There were over one million hospital admissions related to alcohol in 2009/10, so reducing alcohol abuse through successful treatment can help reduce this. The proportion of service users who completed drug treatment free of dependency increased to 47% in 2011/12, from 21% in 2005/06. This was balanced by the decrease in the number of service users who had an incomplete treatment or unknown status at the point of discharge during the same period. The ability to directly compare 2009/10 to 2010/11 data to previous years was affected by changes in coding (see data notes). This suggests that there was undercoding for patients who were referred on/transferred, as the proportion of those who were transferred (combining those in custody and those not) after 2009/10 was approximately 10% higher than those referred before then.</P>",
