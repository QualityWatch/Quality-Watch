In 2009, just over one fifth of staff reported that they felt pressure to attend work when feeling unwell in the previous three months. Subsequently, there was a year-on-year increase in staff reporting feeling pressure to work when feeling unwell, rising to 27% in 2012. This dropped to a quarter of all staff in 2013 and 23% in 2014, which is still greater than when the data was first collected in 2009. <br><br>Ambulance trust staff consistently reported feeling more pressure to attend work when feeling unwell in the previous three months when compared to acute, mental health & learning disability, and community trusts.<br><br>In 2015, this indicator was changed to ask not only whether staff members feel under pressure from colleagues to come to work while unwell but also whether they additionally put themselves under pressure to come to work. Once this is included, the percentage of staff feeling under pressure to go to work when unwell doubled.   <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
