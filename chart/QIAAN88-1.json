"analysis_commentary" : "<P>For the completed financial years 2011/12 and 2012/13, the service managed to successfully meet the 75% target, although there have been six occasions where the target has not been met within an individual month (out of a total of 28 complete months of data), usually between December and March. Between 2010/11 and 2011/12 there was a slight decrease in the proportion of category A calls being reached within eight minutes, from 76.1% to 75.5%. The large drop observed in December 2012, where only 70.8% of calls were met, is attributable to a single trust failing to reach the standard. </P>",
