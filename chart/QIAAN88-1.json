Between 2010\/11 and 2011\/12 there was a slight decrease in the proportion of category A calls being reached within eight minutes, from 76.1% to 75.5%. The large drop observed in December 2012, where only 70.8% of calls were met, is attributable to a single trust failing to reach the standard. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
