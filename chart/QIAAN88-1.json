In particular there was a substantial decrease in performance from March 2014 to December 2014, although some of the change around this period has been driven by London Ambulance Service (see the below chart 'How has the proportion of category A (red 1 and 2) calls attended within 8 minutes varied by commissioning region?'). Subsequent to this there has been some improvement but the national target of reaching 75% of Category A calls within eight minutes has been breached in 20 consecutive months, having not been met since January 2014.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
