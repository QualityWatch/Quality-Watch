However, in some cases, admission is still necessary. In cases where an admission is the result of a mental health crisis, CRHT teams should be involved in the decision to admit and will have assessed the service user prior to admission. The national threshold is that 95% of all admissions to a psychiatric inpatient ward are gate kept by a CRHT team. <br><br>Here we see that, in all quarters, the proportion of admissions which were gate kept by a CRHT team is above the national threshold of 95% and has remained around 98% since 2011\/12 Q3. It dropped to 96.3% in Q1 2015\/16 but has since increased again. <br><br>Updated August 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/mental-health-community-teams-activity\/\">NHS England, Mental Health Community Teams Activity<\/a>"}
