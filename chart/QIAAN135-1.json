However, in some cases, admission is still necessary. In cases where an admission is the result of a mental health crisis, CRHT teams should be involved in the decision to admit and will have assessed the service user prior to admission. The national threshold is that 95% of all admissions to a psychiatric inpatient ward is gate kept by a CRHT team. <br><br>Here we see that, in all quarters, the proportion of admissions which were gate kept by a CRHT team is above the national threshold of 95% and has remained around 98% since 2011-12 Q3. In 2013-14 Q4 this was 98.3%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : ""}
