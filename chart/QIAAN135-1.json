However, in some cases admission is still necessary. In cases where an admission is the result of a mental health crisis, CRHT teams should be involved in the decision to admit and should have assessed the service user prior to admission. The national threshold is that at least 95% of all admissions to psychiatric inpatient wards must be gate-kept by a CRHT team. <br><br>Since Q1 2010\/11, the proportion of admissions to psychiatric wards which were gate-kept by CRHT teams has remained above the national threshold of 95%. There was a slight decrease to 96.3% in Q1 2015\/16, but it has since increased and has been above 98% since Q4 2015\/16.<br><br>Updated January 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/mental-health-community-teams-activity\/\">NHS England, Mental Health Community Teams Activity<\/a>"}
