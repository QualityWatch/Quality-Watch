Between 2006 and 2016, there were increases in rates of new diagnoses for gonorrhoea (a 96% increase from 33.7 to 66.2 per 100,000 population), syphilis (a 77% increase from 6.1 to 10.8 per 100,000 population) and genital herpes (a 54% increase from 37.8 to 58.2 per 100,000 population). Over the same time period, there was a decline in genital warts (a 16% decrease from 136.8 to 114.5 per 100,000 population). From 2012 to 2016, the diagnosis rate for chlamydia decreased by 6% from 393.7 per 100,000 population to 369.7 per 100,000 population.<br><br>The observed rising trends in STIs may be attributed both to more routine testing and case finding in genitourinary medicine and sexual and reproductive health services, but also to continued unsafe sexual behaviour. For example, it is likely that condomless sex associated with HIV seroadaptive behaviours is contributing to the increases in syphilis amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). Of increasing concern is the rise in gonorrhoea diagnosis, especially within a context of antimicrobial resistance for this STI.<br><br>Updated January 2018.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables\">Public Health England, Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): annual data tables<\/a>"}
