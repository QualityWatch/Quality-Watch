Data from 2015 cannot be compared with that of previous years due to a change in the method of data collection. Between 2009 and 2014, the greatest increases in incidence rates of new STI diagnoses were in gonorrhoea (a 121% increase from 30.9 to 68.3 per 100,000 population), syphilis (a 49% increase from 5.5 to 8.1 per 100,000 population) and genital herpes (a 17% increase from 52.6 to 61.4 per 100,000 population). Over the same period, there has been a decline in genital warts (a 10% decrease from 149.2 to 134.6 per 100,000 population). From 2012 to 2014 the incidence rate of chlamydia increased by 8.9% from 182.1 per 100,000 population to 198.4 per 100,000 population.  <br><br>The observed rising trends in STIs may be attributed both to more routine testing and case finding in genitourinary medicine and sexual and reproductive health services, but also to continued unsafe sexual behaviour. For example, it is likely that condomless sex associated with HIV seroadaptive behaviours is contributing to the increases in syphilis amongst men who have sex with men (MSM). Of increasing concern is the rise in gonorrhoea diagnosis, especially within a context of antimicrobial resistance for this STI.<br><br>Updated November 2016.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/sexually-transmitted-infections-stis-annual-data-tables\">Public Health England, Sexually transmitted infections (STIs): annual data tables<\/a>"}
