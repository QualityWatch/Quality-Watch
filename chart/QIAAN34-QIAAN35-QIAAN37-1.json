"analysis_commentary" : "<P>In 2004 and 2005, just over 70% of NHS staff were reporting that they had worked extra hours (both unpaid and paid) than they were contracted to do. This began to steadily fall from 2006, to a low in 2009 of 65% of staff. It then remained static around this proportion until 2011. There was, however, a 5 percentage point increase in 2012, back up to the 70% mark, but it is not known whether this is a sustained trend.</P>",
