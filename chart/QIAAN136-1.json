This is reflected in similar downward trends in the four highest volume specialties: trauma and orthopaedics (2.6 million first outpatient attendances in 2012\/13), allied health professional (AHP) episodes (2.4 million), general surgery (2.0 million) and ophthalmology (1.9 million).  Ophthalmology and AHP specialties have consistently lower proportions of people receiving their first outpatient attendances within 18 weeks of referral compared to all specialities, but only by 1 or 2%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
