However, the UK continues to have one of the highest mortality rates after Ireland. The lowest mortality rates are in Japan Korea and, of the comparator countries, in Spain. Since the late 1990s, the incidence of breast cancer has been increasing in both the UK (from 68.8 per 100,000 women in 1998 to 95 per 100,000 women in 2012) and Spain (from 49.6 per 100,000 women in 1998 to 67.3 per 100,000 women in 2012). However, Spain has had a significantly lower incidence rate and stagnating mortality rate. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
