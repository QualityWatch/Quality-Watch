This has however been decreasing since 2010-11, where it was at a high of £2.1bn. The amount spent on home care for adults under 65 with learning disabilities has seen the biggest rise and has been increasing since 1994-95; it was £0.7bn in 2013-14. Adults under 65 with physical disability or sensory impairment, also generally increased to a high in 2010-11 of £0.3bn, and stayed steady in the following years. Home care expenditure on adults under 65 with mental health needs was the smallest amount, around £0.07bn in 2013-14.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB16111\">Health & social care information centre, Personal Social Services Expenditure and Unit Costs<\/a>"}
