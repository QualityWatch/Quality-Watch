Similarly, the highest survival estimates are breast (women only) (85.0%), melanoma of skin (89.0%) and testis (men only) (97.1%). Understandably, we also see that the survival estimates have reduced between one-year and fiver-year survival estimates. For the lowest, pancreas, this has reduced by 14.6%; the highest, testis (men only), has reduced by only 1.0%. <br><br>While for some of these cancers, the five-year survival estimates seem high, it is important to look at how England and the UK compares to other countries. In 2008, Cancer survival in Europe 1999—2007 by country and age: results of EUROCARE-5—a population-based study <http:\/\/www.thelancet.com\/journals\/lanonc\/article\/PIIS1470-2045(13)70546-1\/abstract>, was published. This study showed that survival rates vary across Europe and that for some cancers such as kidney, stomach, ovarian, colon, and lung cancers, the UK survival rates are low. Although this data covers different years and the UK as a whole, making it not directly comparable, it is important to bare these European comparisons in mind when looking at these data.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Office for National Statistics, Cancer Survival in England"}
