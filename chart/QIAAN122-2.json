Testis (men only) (96.8%), melonoma of skin (90.0%) and thyroid (87.1%) have the highest five-year survival estimated. As expected, we also see that the survival estimates have reduced between one-year and five-year survival estimates. For the lowest, pancreas, this has reduced by 16.3%; the highest, testis (men only), has reduced by only 1.6%.<br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Office for National Statistics, Cancer Survival in England"}
