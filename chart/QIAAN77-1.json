","analysis_commentary" : "<P>Here we are looking at the impact that reablement, intermediate care or rehabilitation services have on older people following a hospital episode. The measure of success is the proportion of people who received a reablement service who are still living in their own home 91 days after discharge. The proportion of older people at home after 91 days has varied little over time. It has remained relatively steady, ranging from 81.2% in 2009\/10 to 82.7% in 2015\/16.<br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href = \"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=Community+Care+Statistics%2C+Social+Services+Activity%2C&area=&size=10&sort=Relevance#top\">NHS Digital, Community Care Statistics, Social Services Activity<\/a>"}
