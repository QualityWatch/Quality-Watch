The measure of success is the proportion of people who received a reablement service who are still living in their own home 91 days after discharge. The proportion of older people at home after 91 days has varied little over time. It has been generally high, between 81.2% and 82.7% in every year we have data and was at 82.5% in 2013\/14.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Adult Social Care - Combined Activity Return (ASC-CAR)"}
