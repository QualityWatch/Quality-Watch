As of 2016 cervical screening coverage amongst women aged 25-64 was 73%. <br><br>Good practice is for women aged 25-49 to be screened every 3.5 years, whilst those aged 50-64 should be screened at least every five years. When we separate these age groups, the increase in coverage in 2008 is only seen in women aged 25 to 49 and not amongst women aged 50-64. The proportion of women aged 50-64 adequately screened has actually been decreasing since 2005, most noticeably from 2009.<br><br>Updated January 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.content.digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB22414\">NHS Digital<\/a>"}
