However, current good practice is for women aged 25-49 to be screened every 3.5 years whilst those aged 50-64 should be screened at least every 5 years. When we separate these age groups, the increase in coverage is only seen in women aged 25 to 49, whilst the proportion of women aged 50-64 has decreased over time.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, breast screening programme and cervical screening programme"}
