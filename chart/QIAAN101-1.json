"analysis_commentary" : "<P>There is an association (R2 greater then 0.7) between deprevation of local authority areas and the all age and all cause mortality  rates for both time periods. These studies provide a compelling case for monitoring inequalities in life expectancy with a view to narrowing the gap between different areas. As noted by Marmot (2010), reducing health inequalities would benefit society in many ways. There would be economic benefits in reducing losses from illness associated with health inequalities. These currently account for productivity losses, reduced tax revenue, higher welfare payments and increased treatment costs.</P>",
