Higher mortality rates in the most deprived parts of the country were observed at both time points even though mortality rates overall had fallen. The reasons behind these differences are complex. These studies provide a compelling case for monitoring inequalities in life expectancy with a view to narrowing the gap between different areas. As noted by Marmot (2010), reducing health inequalities would benefit society in many ways. There would be economic benefits in reducing losses from illness associated with health inequalities. These currently account for productivity losses, reduced tax revenue, higher welfare payments and increased treatment costs.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "APHO, Health Profiles Datasheets 2013"}
