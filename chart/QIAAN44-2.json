The proportion of people who received no support for care responsibilities increased by 4.0% between the two years. The proportion of people who received no support for finding or keeping accommodation, and no support with financial advice or benefits, both decreased by 1.0%. The lowest proportion of people not receiving support in both years is those needing support for physical health needs,  although this increased by 5.0% in the last year surveyed.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Community Mental Health Survey"}
