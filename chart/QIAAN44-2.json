Of all the support types mentioned, help in finding or keeping work was the least supported, as reported by the service users in all years (43% said they did not get any support in 2011, 44% in 2012 and 43% in 2013). <br><br>For the different support areas, physical health needs had the highest proportion of people feeling supported. However, this decreased by 6% over the three years from 2011 to 2013. <br><br>With the exception of help in finding or keeping work, the response to these questions has got slightly worse over time, with a larger proportion not feeling supported in 2013 compared to 2011.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Community Mental Health Survey"}
