However, after 2012\/13 Q3 the total number of maternities decreased significantly and since then there has been an average of 157,000 maternities per quarter - a decrease of around 9,000 maternities. Generally, the number of antenatal assessments happening before 12 weeks and six days of pregnancy was similar across these two time periods, with an average number of 152,000 assessments in both. This suggests that the increase in performance in the proportion of maternities receiving timely antenatal assessments may be in part due to the decrease in number of maternities over time.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/maternity-and-breastfeeding\/\">NHS England, Maternity and Breastfeeding<\/a>"}
