However, from 2012\/13 Q1 onwards this has dipped and since then there was an average of 156,000 maternities in each quarter - a decrease of 10,000. Generally, the number of assessments happening before 12 weeks and six days was similar in these two periods with an average number of 152,000 assessments in both. This suggests that the increase in performance seen in chart 1 may be in part due to the decrease in number of maternities over time. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/maternity-and-breastfeeding\/\">NHS England, Maternity and Breastfeeding<\/a>"}
