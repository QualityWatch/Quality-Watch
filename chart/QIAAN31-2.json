This corresponds to births approximately six months later in Quarter 2 of the following year and Quarter 3 of the same year, respectively. This shows that the pattern seen in Graph 1 (shown here also for reference) is due to the number of maternities and not the service providing antenatal appointments within 12 weeks and six days. Even though there is increased demand during this time of year from Quarter 3 2010\/11, it appears that the service is matching this well with a fairly consistent ratio of maternities having the first antenatal appointment before 12 weeks and six days. With a minimum of 0.92 and maximum of 0.95, the range is 0.04.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Maternity (Vital signs)"}
