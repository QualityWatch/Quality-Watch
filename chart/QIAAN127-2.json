There has been a noticeable increase of 4.1 percentage points of the proportion of staff taking no sickness days from 2013 to 2014 and a decrease in the proportion of staff taking more than 4.1 sickness days; this would in part explain the decrease in the average (mean) sickness days per employee we saw in figure 1. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB16834\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments<\/a>"}
