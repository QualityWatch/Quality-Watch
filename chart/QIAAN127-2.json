There was a noticeable increase of 4.1 percentage points of the proportion of staff taking no sickness days from 2013 to 2014 which would in part explain the decreases we saw in the previous chart. These proportions mean that over 50% of staff took at least one sickness day in each year. A substantial 7% of employees had more than 40 sick days in 2015. These proportions have stayed roughly similar since 2011. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB16834\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments<\/a>"}
