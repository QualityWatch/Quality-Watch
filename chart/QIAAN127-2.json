There has been an increase in the percentage of staff who have taken more than 4.1 sickness days (including categories: '4.1 to 10', '10.1 to 20', '20.1 to 40' and 'more than 40). This increased from 30.0% in 2011 to 34.1% in 2013; the biggest increase was seen in the '4.1 to 10' category. This shift to the groups with more sickness days explains the increase in average we saw in the previous chart.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments"}
