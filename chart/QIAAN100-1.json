Action to address these problems was far reaching and included new legislation as well as focussed investment, regulation and performance monitoring against targets. Since this focus in 2007 the number of C difficile infections has been decreasing year-on-year for all groups to a low in 2013\/14. This has been a decrease of 76% for all cases of 2 years and over, 63% decrease for those 65 years and over, and a decrease of 85% for trust apportioned cases (meaning the bacteraemia was likely to have been acquired while patients were in their care) in those 2 years and over. *annual data for 65 and over only available up to 2010\/11.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health Protection Agency, Mandatory surveillance of bacteraemia"}
