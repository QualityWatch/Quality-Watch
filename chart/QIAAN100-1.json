Action to address these problems was far reaching and included new legislation as well as focussed investment, regulation and performance monitoring against targets. Since this focus in 2007 the number of C difficile infections decreased year-on-year for all groups to a low in 2013\/14. In 2014\/15 there was a slight increase from the previous year in C difficile infections, a 6.0% increase for all cases of 2 years and over and a 3.6% increase for trust apportioned cases (meaning the bacteraemia was likely to have been acquired while patients were in their care) in those 2 years and over.  *annual data for 65 and over only available up to 2010\/11.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health Protection Agency, Mandatory surveillance of bacteraemia"}
