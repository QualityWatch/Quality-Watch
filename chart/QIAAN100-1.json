Action to address these problems was far reaching and included new legislation as well as focused investment, regulation and performance monitoring against targets. Since this focus in 2007, the number of C difficile infections has been decreasing for all groups, to a low in 2010\/11. This has been a decrease of 61% for all cases of two years and over; 63% decrease for those 65 years and over; and a decrease of 69% for trust apportioned cases in those two years and over. *annual data for 65 and over only available up to 2010\/11<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health Protection Agency, Mandatory surveillance of bacteraemia"}
