Both coronary artery bypass grafts and angioplasty have been essential in treating patients with IHD. Over time, we can observe a declining trend in bypass surgeries, the more invasive form of treatment, while there has been an upward trend in angioplasties, the less invasive procedure. However, the two procedures are not direct substitutes (McGuire et al., 2014). United States and Germany have the highest rates of Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and angioplasty. Data from United States is reported differently to other contries included, please see about this data for more information. For both, UK follows the trends of other countries but has significantly less procedures, especially for the less invasive angioplasty. Large variations in the rates of procedures do not seem to be closely related to the incidence of IHD, as measured by IHD mortality (OECD, 2013). For example, UK and Germany have very similar IHD mortality, yet Germany has the highest rate of revascularisation procedures. Differences in capacity to pay for and deliver these procedures, differences in treatment guidelines and physician practices, and coding and reporting practices may explain these variations (OECD, 2013).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : ""}
