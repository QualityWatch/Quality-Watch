Initial figures  for January - September 2013 suggests no recent changes in this trend. A similar percentage of patients (25% 2012\/13) said that they felt they had to wait “a bit too long” and a further 9% said that they had to wait “far too long”. Again in the three proceeding years, these proportions were very similar. Although between 2009\/10 and 2012\/13 there has been a decrease of 5% in the percentage of patients who said that they “don't normally have to wait too long”. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England,  GP Patient Survey"}
