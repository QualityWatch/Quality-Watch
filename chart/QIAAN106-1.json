An equivalent proportion of patients (25% 2012\/13) also said that they felt they had to wait a bit too long and a further 9% said that they had to wait far too long. Again in the three proceeding years these proportions were not very much different. Although between 2009\/10 and 2012\/13 there has been a decrease of 5% in the proportion of patients who said that they don't normally have to wait too long.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/gp-patient.co.uk\/surveys-and-reports#jan-2015\">NHS England, GP patient survey<\/a>"}
