Babies under the age of three months are too young to have completed a primary course of pertussis vaccine but the incidence of the disease is the highest in infants of that age and they have the greatest risk of complications and death. In response to a national outbreak the Department of Health announced that pertussis immunisation would be offered to pregnant women from 1 October 2012 to protect infants from birth by boosting the short-term immunity to babies by women passing on antibodies to their children intra-uterine until they can be vaccinated themselves (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dh.gov.uk\/health\/2012\/09\/whooping-cough\">Department of Health<\/a>).<br><br>Pertussis vaccination coverage in pregnant women is not very high but from July 2013 over half of those eligible have taken up the immunisation and since its introduction there has been an in uptake from 44% in October 2012 to its highest level of 62% in December 2014. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/collections\/vaccine-uptake\">Public Health England, Prenatal Pertussis Vaccine Coverage Monitoring Programme<\/a>"}
