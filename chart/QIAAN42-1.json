Here we look solely at overnight admissions. Part of the rise in readmissions could be explained by the move towards more 'less complex' cases being treated as day cases. By removing these day cases, this measure only includes 'more complex' cases, which are more likely to result in readmission.<br><br>The percentage of readmissions increased in all regions between 2001\/02 and 2010\/11. The smallest increase was in the East Midlands from 9.9% to 11.7% and the East of England from 9.0% to 10.8%, both an increase of 1.8% and the greatest was in London from 8.8% to 12.0%, an increase of 3.2%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
