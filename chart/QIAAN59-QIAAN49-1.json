"analysis_commentary" : "<P>The percentage of respondents to the Adult Inpatient Survey, who felt they were involved as much as they wanted to be in their care and treatment, remained stable from 2007 to 2011, but increased significantly between 2011 and 2012, rising from 52% to 55%. This was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the percentage of patients who felt they were not involved as much as they wanted to be in their care and treatment, which for 2012 was ten per cent of all respondents.</P>",
