There is a downward trend in the number of patients delayed over time when the delay is due to social care organisations but an upward trend when the delay is due to NHS organisations or when both organisations are responsible. For NHS there is a 13% increase in the number of patients experiencing a delay in discharge, a 28% increase when both types of organisations are responsible and a 26% decrease when the responsibility is down to social care organisations. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\"> NHS England, Delayed transfer of care <\/a>"}
