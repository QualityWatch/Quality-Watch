There is a relatively flat trend in the number of patients delayed over time when the delay is due to NHS and social care organisations combined. There is, however, an upward trend in delays due to NHS or Social care organisations separately. <br><br>Between January 2011 and January 2017 there were 1193 more patients experiencing a delay where the NHS was responsible, a 42% increase. Over the same period there were 1040 more patients with a delay due to social care, representing a 71% increase.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
