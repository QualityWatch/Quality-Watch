There is a relatively flat trend over time when a delay is the responsibility of both an NHS and social care organisation. There is, however, an upward trend when a delay is the sole responsibility of an NHS or social care organisation.<br><br>Between September 2010 and September 2017 there were 855 more delayed transfer of care beds where the NHS was responsible, representing a 37% increase. Over the same period there were 769 more delayed transfer of care beds due to social care, representing a 61% increase.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/delayed-transfers-of-care-data-2017-18\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
