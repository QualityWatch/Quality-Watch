There is a relatively flat trend in the number of patients delayed over time when the delay is due to social care organisations or when both NHS and social care organisations are responsible. There is, however, an upward trend in delays due to NHS organisations. <br><br>The absolute difference between August 2010 and April 2016 is an increase of 622 patients experiencing a delay when the NHS is the responsible organisation. Looking at the difference between November 2010 and November 2015 this is an absolute difference of 804 patients experiencing a delay, which is a 30% increase.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
