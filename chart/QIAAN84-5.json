However, social care organisations appear to have improved the discharge interface the most, as there was a 39% decrease in the number of patients experiencing a delay in discharge between August 2010 (1,723 patients) and July 2013 (1,051 patients), when attributable to social care organisations. This is compared to a 9% decrease when attributable to NHS organisations, and a 7% decrease when attributable to both.</P>",
