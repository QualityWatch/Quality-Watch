There is a relatively flat trend in the number of patients delayed over time when the delay is due to social care organisations or when both NHS and social care organisations are responsible. There is, however, an upward trend when the delay is due to NHS organisations, <br><br>Although the absolute difference between August 2010 and December 2015 is an increase of only 86 patients experiencing a delay when the NHS is the responsible organisation, this is partly related to the annual decreases seen in December. Instead, looking at the difference between November 2010 and November 2015 this is an absolute difference of 804 patients experiencing a delay, which is a 30 per cent increase.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
