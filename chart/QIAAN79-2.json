Depending on the treatment type the proportion of patients who should receive subsequent treatment within the 31 days differs.<br><br>Here we can see that anti-cancer drug regimes have the highest proportions (over 99%) of people receiving their first treatments within 31 days for all time periods. Anti-cancer drug treatment also has the highest target of 98% of people starting subsequent treatment within 31 days. This has been met in every quarter. The proportion of people having surgery within 31 days of the decision to treat is lower overall and is more variable over the time period. This has decreased in the last four quarters to be 96.3% in 2014\/15 quarter 1. Despite this, it still exceeds the 94% target in every quarter. Similarly, radiotherapy has the target of 94% of people starting subsequent treatment within 31 days, this target has been met in every quarter and has always been over 97%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
