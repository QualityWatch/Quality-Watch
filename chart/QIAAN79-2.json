Depending on the treatment type the proportion of patients who should receive subsequent treatment within the 31 days differs.<br><br>Here we can see that anti-cancer drug regimes have the highest proportions (over 99%) of people receiving their first treatments within 31 days for all time periods. Anti-cancer drug treatment also has the highest target of 98% of people starting subsequent treatment within 31 days. This has been met in every quarter. The proportion of people having surgery within 31 days of the decision to treat is lower overall and is more variable over the time period. Despite this, it exceeds the 94% target, and it has increased over time, staying above 97.0% since 2011\/12 Quarter 4. Similarly, radiotherapy has the target of 94% of people starting subsequent treatment within 31 days, this target has been met in every quarter and has always been over 97%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
