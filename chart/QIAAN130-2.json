One is preventing high blood pressure, and the percentage of patients diagnosed with stage 3-5 CKD that had had their blood pressure recorded in the last 15 months has never fallen below 97%.  The percentage of patients whose blood pressure is below the recommended maximum (140\/85) has been increasing slowly for many years. For CKD patients with hypertension and proteinuria it is often appropriate to control high blood pressure using drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers.  The proportion of patients being treated in this way - where it would be appropriate to do so - has been declining slightly since 2009\/10, though was still at 89% in 2012\/13.  The urine albumin creatinine ratio (ACR) is used to monitor the progress of a patient's kidney disease.  The percentage of CKD patients that have an ACR recorded in the last 15 months was consistent at 82% since 2010\/11.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Quality and Outcomes Framework"}
