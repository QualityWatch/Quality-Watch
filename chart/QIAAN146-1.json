The percentage of children and young people with diabetes who had their glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, urinary albumin, cholesterol, BMI (both height and weight) recorded,  eyes screened and feet examined has been increasing over time in England and Wales. However, the proportion having their urinary albumin and cholesterol measured, eyes screened and foot examined still lags behind the other processes (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure). <br><br>While the proportion of 12 year olds and older with all care processes recorded has increased from 2% in 2004\/2005 to 16.1% in 2013\/2014, many children still do not receive the recommended care for diabetes. Comparatively, the proportion of adults receiving all care processes in 2012\/13 was approximately 60%.<br><br>Furthermore the Audit finds that in England only slightly more than two thirds of children (12+) have their smoking status recorded, 52% have their thyroid function tested, 45% are tested for coeliac disease and 48% receive a psychological assessment (data not shown).  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rcpch.ac.uk\/improving-child-health\/quality-improvement-and-clinical-audit\/national-paediatric-diabetes-audit-n-0\">Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health, National Paediatric Diabetes Audit<\/a> "}
