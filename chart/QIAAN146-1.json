The percentage of children and young people with diabetes who had their glycated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, urinary albumin, cholesterol, BMI (both height and weight) recorded,  eyes screened and feet examined has been increasing over time in England and Wales. However, the proportion having their urinary albumin and cholesterol measured, eyes screened and foot examined still lags behind the other processes (HbA1c, BMI, blood pressure). While the proportion of 12 year olds and older with all care processes recorded has increased from 2% in 2004\/2005 to 12% in 2012\/2013, many children still do not receive the recommended care for diabetes. Comparatively, the proportion of adults receiving all care processes in 2012\/13 was approximately 60%.<br><br>According to the most recent audit, figures for Type 1 diabetes between 2010-11 and 2012-13 suggest variation but not a clear trend (NPDA 2012-13 Audit). As is noted in the audit, these figures need to be interpreted with caution as changes may be due to better coverage of patient with diabetes. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "National Paediatric Diabetes Audit, HQIP and RCPCH"}
