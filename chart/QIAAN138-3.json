While it is medically required in some situations, overuse of C-sections in Western countries has been linked to adverse outcomes for the mother and the child and is also unnecessarily costly (Gibbons et al, WHO, 2010). The graph shows that there are significant cross-country variations between the selected OECD countries. Finland and the Netherlands have one of the lowest rates while Italy is an outlier with over 350 C-sections per 1000 live births between 2000 and 2012. Apart from Italy, UK has high and increasing C-section rates relative to the Nordic countries. Some countries have stabilised the C-section rates (e.g. Canada, Spain, France) or reversed the trend, as in Italy. There are several reasons that can explain high rates of C-sections, including C-sections being considered less risky, malpractice liability concerns, scheduling convenience or patient preference, difference between a private and public facility, increase in first births among older women and multiple births, among others (OECD, 2013).  <br><br>Further in depth analysis is required for all these surgical indicators. For example, for C-sections and angioplasty it would be important to disaggregate into emergency and elective procedures and for C-sections to look at the relationship with staffing (e.g. consultant cover, midwife to birth ratio).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "OECD, Health Statistics 2013"}
