The UK has a relatively high rate of infant mortality compared to other countries with 3.9 deaths per 1000 live births in 2014. The country with the highest rate each year is the USA while Iceland, Finland and Sweden have the lowest rates. <br><br>One of the <a href=\"http:\/\/mdgs.un.org\/unsd\/mdg\/Host.aspx?Content=Indicators\/OfficialList.htm\">United Nations Millennium Development Goals<\/a> was to reduce child mortality by two-thirds, between 1990 and 2015. According to this MDG the UK should have reduced the 1990 infant mortality rate of 7.9 to 2.6 by 2015. The most recent data available (2014) suggest that the UK will struggle to meet this target. In 2015 the MDG goals were replaced by the Sustainable Development Goals where maternal and child health remains one of the key goals (Goal 3 \"Ensure health lives and promote well-being for all at all ages\"). <br><br>Updated March 2017.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.oecd.org\/els\/health-systems\/health-data.htm\">OECD, Health Statistics<\/a>"}
