This can include the types of care services provided, how much care provision there is and information on the workforce. For more information on this data please see 'about this data' below. <br><br>We can see that by far the largest sector of adult social care workers are employed by the private sector, accounting for 58%. The next largest group of workers are employed by the voluntary sector; this was 20% in 2014.
