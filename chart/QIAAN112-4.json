There were a total of 49,469 readmissions within 28 days of discharge from hospital following hip fracture during the study. Overall the number of readmissions increased by 68.9%, rising from 3,658 in 2001\/02 to 6,180 in 2010\/11. The crude readmission rate over the 10-year period was 9.7%. Figure 1.6 summarises the change in age- and sex-standardised readmission rates after hip fracture. In contrast to mortality rates, the 28-day readmission rate increased dramatically, rising from 80.3 per 1,000 admissions in 2001\/02 to 113.4 per 1,000 admissions in 2010\/11, an overall increase of 41.3% over 10 years.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
