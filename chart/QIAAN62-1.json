This includes fear of abuse, falling or other physical harm and fear of being attacked or robbed”. Users can answer: 'I feel as safe as I want', 'Generally I feel adequately safe, but not as safe as I would like', 'I feel less than adequately safe' or 'I don't feel safe at all'. <br><br>Here, we report only on those who felt as safe as they wanted to. The proportion of people who felt as safe as they wanted to increased from 62.4% in 2010\/11 to 63.8% in 2012\/13; an increase of 1.4%. However as the data in 2010\/11 is un-weighted it is more appropriate to look at the 1.2% increase from 2011\/12 to 2012\/13. Despite the improvements, there were still roughly 35% who didn't feel as safe as they wanted to in 2012-13.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Adult Social Care Survey"}
