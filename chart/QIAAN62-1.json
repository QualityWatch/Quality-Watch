Users can answer: 'I feel as safe as I want', 'Generally I feel adequately safe, but not as safe as I would like', 'I feel less than adequately safe' or 'I don't feel safe at all'. <br><br>Here, we report only on those who felt as safe as they wanted to. The changes to the methodology create a break in the time series in 2014-2015 and comparison to previous years is not possible. The proportion of people who felt as safe as they wanted to in 2014-15 is 68.5%, leaving 31.5% who didn't feel as safe as they wanted to in the same year.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/article\/2021\/Website-Search?productid=18966&q=Personal+Social+Services+Adult+Social+Care+Survey%2c+England&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1&area=both#top\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Adult Social Care Survey<\/a>"}
