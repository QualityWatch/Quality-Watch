The narrowing of the national gap in employment for people with LTCs between 2006 and 2010 was reflected by falls in all regions of England, though reductions were greater in some regions than others. Since 2011, gaps in all areas have increased again, though in most cases were still lower in 2014\/15 Q3 than they were in 2006\/07 Q2. In most regions the gap increased at similar rates, although Merseyside appeared increase much more sharply and the gap was 19.2% in 2014\/15 Q3. It is worth noting that Merseyside is by far the smallest region and is about 7th the size of the largest region (London) so we may be seeing more variation here due to it's comparatively smaller size.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
