The narrowing of the national gap in employment for people with LTCs between 2006 and 2010 was reflected by falls in all regions of England, though reductions were greater in some regions than others. For example, the eastern region fell from 13% to 8% at the end of 2010\/11, and Merseyside experiencing a 8% reduction.  Since 2011, gaps in all areas have increased again, though in most cases were still lower in 2013\/14 Q3 than they were in 2006\/07 Q2.  In most regions the gap increased at similar rates, although  Merseyside appeared increase much more sharply.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
