The narrowing of the national gap in employment for people with LTCs between 2006 and 2010 was reflected by falls in all regions of England, though reductions were greater in some regions than others. <br><br>Since 2011, gaps in all areas have increased again. In most regions the gap increased at similar rates, although Merseyside appeared to increase much more sharply and the gap was 19.1 percentage points in 2014\/15 Q3. It is worth noting that Merseyside is by far the smallest region and is about a 7th the size of the largest region (London) so variation may be due to its comparatively small size.<br><br>Updated August 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/\">NHS Outcomes Framework, NHS Digital<\/a>"}
