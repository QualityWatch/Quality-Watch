The number of trusts performing 200 or more percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCAs) a year has increased markedly since 2001\/02 with fewer than 23% of providers not meeting this standard in 2012\/13. This has also been accompanied by a dramatic fall in the absolute number of trusts performing fewer operations than the recommended threshold. There is a particularly sharp increase in the number of providers meeting the standard in 2006\/07 which is driven by a dramatic increase in the number of PTCAs being performed in hospitals nationally, rising from approximately 4,600 PTCAs in 2005\/06 to approximately 44,900 in 2006\/07. After this spike the number of PTCAs has increased steadily to approximately 69,100 in 2012\/13.  The majority of trusts not meeting the standard, however, perform fewer than 5 PTCA operations within the year and so a caveat must be added around the accuracy of coding data: without access to full medical records it is impossible to assess if these small numbers are genuine, or a result of incorrectly submitted data.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
