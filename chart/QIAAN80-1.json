These targets were that 90% of admitted people and 95% of non-admitted people should be treated within 18 weeks. For 'incomplete pathways', where patients have been referred but treatment has not yet started, the target was 92%. <br><br>In August 2014, a <a href=\" http:\/\/m.hsj.co.uk\/5073561.article \">'managed breach'<\/a> of admitted and non-admitted targets was introduced which allowed hospitals to miss these targets without consequence. This managed breach lasted until December 2015 and corresponds to the dip in performance we observe at that time. After this breach it was decided in June 2015 to permanently abolish the admitted and non-admitted targets and that the incomplete target would become the sole measure to monitor treatment waiting times performance. In the latest data available, December 2015, this target was breached for the first time with 91.8% of people spending less than 18 weeks on the waiting list for treatment. It was breached again in March and April 2016. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/rtt-waiting-times\/\">NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times<\/a>"}
