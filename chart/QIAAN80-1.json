The targets were that 90% of admitted patients and 95% of non-admitted patients should be treated within 18 weeks of referral. For 'incomplete pathways', where patients have been referred but treatment has not yet started, the target was set at 92%. In August 2014, a <a href=\" http:\/\/m.hsj.co.uk\/5073561.article \">'managed breach'<\/a> of admitted and non-admitted targets was introduced which allowed hospitals to miss these targets without consequence. This managed breach lasted until December 2015 and corresponds to the dip in performance we observe at that time. After this breach it was decided in June 2015 to permanently abolish the admitted and non-admitted targets and that the incomplete target would become the sole measure of treatment waiting time performance.<br><br>The 92% target for incomplete pathways was breached for the first time in December 2015. As of September 2017, performance had fallen further with only 89.1% of people spending less than 18 weeks on the waiting list for treatment.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/rtt-waiting-times\/\">NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times<\/a>"}
