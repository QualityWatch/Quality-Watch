These targets were that: 90% of admitted people should be treated within 18 weeks, 95% for non-admitted people and 92% for incomplete pathways. <br><br>In February 2014, a target was breached for the first time, with the proportion of admitted referrals treated in less than 18 weeks falling below 90% and this trend continued to a low of 89.4% in March 2014. Since then it has remained at or below 90%. Looking at the pattern of waiting times for people on non-admitted pathways and incomplete pathways we can see that the proportion treated within 18 weeks has been decreasing for both however neither of these measures have breached their targets.<br><br>In August 2014, a <a href=\" http:\/\/m.hsj.co.uk\/5073561.article \">'managed breach'<\/a> of admitted and non-admitted targets was introduced which allowed hospitals to miss these targets without consequence. This managed breach lasted until December 2014 and corresponds to the dip in performance we observe at that time. In particular, the proportion of admitted patients receiving treatment within 18 weeks dipped to its lowest level to date of 87.5%. After this breach it was decided in June 2015 to permanently abolish the admitted and non-admitted targets and that the incomplete target would become the sole measure to monitor treatment waiting times performance. In the latest data available, June 2015, this target was being met with 93.2% of people spending less than 18 weeks on the waiting list for treatment.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
