The targets were that 90% of admitted patients and 95% of non-admitted patients should be treated within 18 weeks of referral. For 'incomplete pathways', where patients have been referred but treatment has not yet started, the target was set at 92%. In June 2015 the admitted and non-admitted targets were abolished and the incomplete target became the sole measure of treatment waiting time performance.<br><br>The 92% target for incomplete pathways was breached for the first time in December 2015. Since then performance has worsened, and as of February 2018 only 87.9% of people waited less than 18 weeks to start consultant-led treatment.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/rtt-waiting-times\/\">NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times<\/a>"}
