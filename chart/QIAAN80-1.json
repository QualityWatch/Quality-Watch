We also see an annual pattern with peaks in the median wait time in January and February which are due to people waiting for treatment over the winter. The median number of weeks from referral to treatment for incomplete pathways has decreased over time and has been between five and six weeks since January 2012. For non-admitted pathways, the long-term trend shows the median wait time has been around four weeks since February 2008. However since February 2012, the median has been increasing, most noticeably since March 2013. In April 2013, non-consultant led sexual health treatments no longer had to report against the 18-week target and so were no longer included in the data shown. It is likely that the removal of these contribute to some of the increase we see here for non-admitted pathways, however there is no data available to explore this further.<br><br>For more information on the different pathways, please see 'about this data'.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
