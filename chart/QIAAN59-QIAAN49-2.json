"analysis_commentary" : "<P>Nationally, the majority (72%) of outpatients surveyed in 2011 felt they were &lsquo;definitely&rsquo; involved as much as they wanted to be in decisions about their care and treatment. This was a small increase on the 2009 result (70%) which had not changed since the first time the survey took place, in 2003. This increase was offset by a decrease in the percentage of outpatients who reported they were involved to &lsquo;some extent&rsquo; in decisions about their treatment and care. There had been no change across all years in the percentage of outpatients who reported that they were not involved as much as they wanted to be in decisions about their care and treatment.</P>",
