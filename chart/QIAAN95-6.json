In the same year, it appears that repeat appointments contribute more heavily to this overall change, with 26% of those attending a repeat appointment reporting a change in date compared to just 14% of those attending a first appointment. Again, we see little connection between experiences reported in the Outpatient Survey and the changes in cancelled operations data observed above.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients and Survey of Outpatients"}
