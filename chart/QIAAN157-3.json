The majority of users finish the treatment and are completely free from drugs and alcohol. In 2014\/15, 52% of adult service users successfully completed treatment, up from 43% in 2009\/10.<br><br>There is variation across user groups however. The proportion of non-opiate drug users who successfully completed treatment was higher than any other user group (64% in 2014\/15) and successful completion was the lowest in opiate drug users (30% in 2014\/15). <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nta.nhs.uk\/statistics.aspx\">Public Health England, National Drug Treatment Monitoring System<\/a>"}
