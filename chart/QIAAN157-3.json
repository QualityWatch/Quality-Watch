From 2011-12 onwards the majority of users finished the treatment and were free from drugs and alcohol. In 2015-16, 50% of adult service users successfully completed treatment, up from 43% in 2009-10. Opiate users have the lowest levels of service users completing treatment free of dependence (28% in 2015-16) whilst non-opiate users generally show the highest levels (60% in 2015-16).<br><br>Updated January 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nta.nhs.uk\/statistics.aspx\">Public Health England, National Drug Treatment Monitoring System<\/a>"}
