This can cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke, such as speech and visual disturbance and numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. However, a TIA does not last as long a stroke. The effects only last for a few minutes and are usually fully resolved within 24 hours. The risk of stroke within four weeks of a TIA can be as high as 20%. It is therefore vital that people with TIA are investigated quickly. The audit shows that the proportion of high-risk TIA inpatients and outpatients being investigated have both improved in 2012, with inpatients performing better overall. Low-risk outpatients performed highest out of all groups in both years. Low-risk inpatients is the only outcome to perform worse in 2012 going from 22% to 14% a decrease of eight percentage points in two years.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Royal College of Physicians, National Stroke Audit"}
