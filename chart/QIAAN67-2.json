"analysis_commentary" : "<P>The risk of stroke within four weeks of a TIA can be as high as 20%. It is therefore vital that people with TIA are investigated quickly. The proportion of high risk TIA inpatients and outpatients being investigated have both improved in 2012, with inpatients performing better overall. Low risk outpatients performed highest out of all groups in both years. Low risk inpatients is the only outcome to perform worse in 2012 going from 22% to 14% a decrease of 8 percentage points in two years. </P>",
