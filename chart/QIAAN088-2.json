In particular, there has been deterioration in performance across all regions since March 2014. London was consistently and clearly the best performing region until March 2014. This was followed by a substantial drop in performance, falling below 85% in December 2014. Performance did recover after this, however performance is currently below target as of January 2017 (91%).
