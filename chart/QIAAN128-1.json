In practice this means identifying some threshold minimum number of operations per year. Each year there are approximately 20,00 coronary artery bypass grafts (CABGs) performed and the National Service Framework for Coronary Heart Disease has recommended a minimum of 400 CABGs should be carried out each year by a single institution. Using hospital admissions data we can estimate by year the number of people in each hospital with codes indicating CABG surgery. These data suggest that the number of trusts performing 400 or more CABG procedures a year has remained fairly constant since April 2001 with approximately 45% of trusts meeting this standard. The majority of trusts not meeting the standard, however, perform fewer than 5 CABG operations within the year and so a caveat must be added around the potential accuracy of coding data: without access to full medical records it is impossible to assess if these small numbers are genuine, or a result of incorrectly submitted data.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
