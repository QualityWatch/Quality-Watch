This increased to around 15% in 2012 but it is not directly comparable to the previous year, as the way in which staff could respond to the question changed, making the responses more sensitive. The percentage of staff who reported experiencing physical violence from patients\/relatives in the past 12 months has continued to decrease since 2012 and is now 12%.<br><br>Staff in mental health & learning disability trusts and ambulance trusts reported experiencing violence with the same broad pattern as the national response, but at a much higher response - 2.5 times higher for ambulance trusts. This is likely to be a result of the nature of the patients that staff within these groups treat.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
