The increase to around 15% observed in 2012is not directly comparable, as the question has changed and the way in which staff could respond in 2012 made the responses more sensitive. The columns in a lighter shade represent responses from staff in mental health and learning disability trusts only. This follows the same broad pattern as the national response, but at a much higher response (at least double between 2007 and 2011).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS Staff"}
