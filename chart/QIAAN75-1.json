Though this increased to around 15% in 2012 this t is not directly comparable to the previous year, as the question changed the way in which staff could respond making the responses more sensitive. There was little change in 2013 compared to 2012 where nationally 14% of staff reported experiencing physical violence from patients\/relatives in the past 12 months.<br><br>Staff in mental health and learning disability trusts and ambulance trusts reported experiencing violence with the same broad pattern as the national response, but at a much higher response - approximately double for mental health and learning disability trusts between 2007 and 2011 and more for ambulance trusts. This could be a result of the nature of the patients that staff within these groups treat.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS Staff"}
