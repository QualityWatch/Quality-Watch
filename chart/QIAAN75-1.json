This increased to around 15% in 2012 but it is not directly comparable to the previous year, as the way in which staff could respond to the question changed, making the responses more sensitive. The percentage of staff who reported experiencing physical violence from patients\/relatives decreased to 12% in 2015. This then increased in 2016 back to 15%.<br><br>Staff in mental health & learning disability trusts (21% in 2016) and ambulance trusts (32% in 2016) consistently report higher levels of violence over the period compared to staff from other trust groups.
