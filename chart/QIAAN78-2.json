The highest rates in 2015\/16 were seen for haematological malignancies, other cancers, testicular cancer and brain\/CNS. The lowest rate in both years was seen for upper gastrointestinal cancer. For about half of the cancer types, performance improved in 2015\/16 but for the other half it has deteriorated. In particular the proportion of people with an urgent referral for acute leukaemia seen within 2 weeks has decreased by 4.2 percentage points. Performance between Quarter 1 2014\/15 and Quarter 1 2015\/16 has improved most for breast cancer (2.3%).<br><br>Please note that some of these cancers are very rare (data not shown) and changes in a small number of cases can have a large effect on the proportions.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
