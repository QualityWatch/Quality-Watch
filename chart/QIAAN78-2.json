The highest rates were seen for testicular cancer, lung cancer, haematological malignancies and leukaemia. The lowest rate in both years was seen for upper gastrointestinal cancer. For the majority of cancer types performance was worse in 2014\/15 compared to 2013\/14. In particular the proportion of people with an urgent referral for breast cancer seen within 2 weeks has decreased by 4.5 percentage points. Only leukaemia and brain cancer improved in performance in 2014\/15 compared to 2013\/14.<br><br>Please note that some of these cancers are very rare (data not shown) and changes in a small number of cases can have a large effect on the proportions.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
