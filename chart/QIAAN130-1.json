People with stage 5 CKD experience end stage renal failure and will either require a kidney transplant or regular sessions of dialysis. Patients with CKD can readily be identified if pathology labs estimate Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when they measure creatinine and there is strong evidence that good blood pressure control in patients with CKD alters their outcome.<br><br>The prevalence of patients with CKD stage 3-5, based on GP practice registers reported through QOF, has remained steady at between 4.1 and 4.3% since 2008\/09.  While the prevalence appeared to increase notably between 2006 and 2008, this is likely to reflect increased numbers of diagnoses being made as a result of raised awareness of CKD and better recording of CKD status.  Much of this will have been related to the introduction of CKD measures in the QOF programme.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Quality and Outcomes Framework"}
