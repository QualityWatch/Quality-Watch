For more information about this measure, please see 'about this data' below. For the one-year estimated survival data, there is large variation between the cancer types. Pancreas, lung and oesophagus have the lowest one-year survival, with 19.6%, 32.9% and 42.0% respectively. The highest one-year survival estimates are breast (women only), melanoma of the skin and testis (men only); with 95.8%, 97.0% and 98.1% respectively.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Office for National Statistics, Cancer Survival in England"}
