For more information about this measure, please see 'about this data' below. For the one-year estimated survival data, there is large variation between the cancer types. Pancreas, liver and lung have the lowest one-year survival; with 21.9%, 35% and 36.9% respectively. The highest one-year survival estimates are testis (men only), melonoma of the skin and breast (women only); with 98.4%, 97.6% and 96.3% respectively. <br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/healthandsocialcare\/conditionsanddiseases\/bulletins\/cancersurvivalinenglandadultsdiagnosed\/previousReleases\">Office for National Statistics, Cancer Survival in England<\/a>"}
