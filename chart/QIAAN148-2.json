The use of thrombolysis in heart attack patients has been diminishing, even though it still remains the gold standard treatment for acute stroke patients (Audit). The small proportion of patients who do receive thrombolysis or for various reasons have not received reperfusion therapy, should receive angiography. We observe a gradual increase over time in the use angiography, from 31.9% in 2004\/5 to 72.2% in 2013\/14. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "HQIP, National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, The British Cardiovascular Society"}
