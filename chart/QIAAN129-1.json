The data covers NHS funded treatment in 2012\/13 and excludes privately funded treatment. Lower surgery rates can be observed in the most deprived areas, particularly in the bottom two deciles, with higher rates of treatment in the more affluent parts of the country. There is some evidence in the literature (Chaturvedi and Ben-Shlomo, 1995)that there is a higher prevalence of joint problems in more deprived areas, for example higher rates of GP consultation for osteoarthritis (the most common reason for requiring a hip replacement). The lower rates of procedures in the more deprived areas could be potentially indicative of some unmet need (and an example of the \"inverse care law\").<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
