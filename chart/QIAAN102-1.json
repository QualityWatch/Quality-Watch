For more information about how this is calculated, see 'about these data' below. <br><br>The difference in mortality rates between the general population and people under 75 years with serious mental illness is large; being over three times higher than the rest of the population. There has been little progress in reducing this gap between 2008/09 and 2014/15. We also see that for both the general population and those with serious mental health illness, mortality rates are higher in males compared to females. <br><br>Updated January 2017. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http://content.digital.nhs.uk/catalogue/PUB22426\">NHS Digital, Outcomes Framework indicators<\/a>"}
