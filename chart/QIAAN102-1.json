For more information about how this is calculated, see 'about these data' below. <br>Analysis over a number of years suggest that the mortality rate for people with serious mental illness (under 75) are over three times higher than the rest of the population. There appears to have been little progress to reduce this gap over the time period measured. We also see that for both the general population and those with serious mental health illness, mortality rates are higher in males compared to females. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, NHS Outcomes Framework indicator portal"}
