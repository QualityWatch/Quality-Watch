For more information about how this is calculated, see 'about these data' below. <br><br>The difference in mortality rates between the general population and people under 75 years with serious mental illness is large; being over three times higher than the rest of the population.

We also see that for both the general population and those with serious mental health illness, mortality rates are higher in males compared to females. <br><br>Updated January 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB22426\">NHS Digital, NHS Outcomes Framework indicator portal<\/a>"}
