From August 2010 to April 2016, there was a 20% increase in the number of patients who experienced a delayed transfer of care: an absolute increase of 984 patients. The number of patients in non-acute care who experienced a delayed transfer actually decreased by 17% (403 patients) in this time period. The overall increase was due to a 54% (1,387 patients) increase in the transfer of acute care patients.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
