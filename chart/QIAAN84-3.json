While there is a 24 per cent increase in the number of patients who received acute care with a similar pattern to the total number of patients this is not the case for patients who received non-acute care. Over the same period when receiving non-acute care the number of patients who had a delayed transfer of care decreased from 2,381 patients in August 2010 to 1,843 in December 2015 (a 23 per cent decrease).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
