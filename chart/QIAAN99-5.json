Common tasks include: offering parenting support and advice on family health and minor illnesses, new birth visits which include advice on feeding, weaning and dental health, physical and developmental checks providing families with specific support on subjects such as postnatal depression.<br><br>In October 2010, the Government made a commitment to increase the numbers of health visiting staff aiming for an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015. The number of health visiting staff (FTE) has increased from 8,092 in May 2010 to 11,331 in May 2015, but this has missed the target. <br><br>There are also additional fears that this growth in the number of health visitors will not be sustained as the Department of Health has said it will be “open” to local authorities to make financial savings from health visitor budgets when a total of £200m public health cuts are delivered to councils early next year, as long as they meet their statutory duties.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/searchcatalogue?productid=18409&topics=0%2fWorkforce&sort=Relevance&size=100&page=1#top\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, NHS Hospital & Community Health Service Workforce Statistics<\/a>"}
