In particular, we see an annual pattern with peaks in the median wait time in December to February each year which are due to people waiting for treatment over the winter. On the graph a line has been added to show the underlying trend. This trend in median wait times from referral to decision to treat for admitted people increased between May 2014 and 2017; waits for  non-admitted pathways increased by 0.6 weeks, waits for admitted pathways increased by 0.8 week and incomplete pathway waits also increased by 0.9 weeks over the same time period.<br><br>Updated July 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/rtt-waiting-times\/\">NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times<\/a>"}
