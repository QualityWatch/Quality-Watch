As well as the long-term trend, waiting times show small fluctuations from month to month. In particular, we see an annual pattern with peaks in the median wait time in December to February each year which are due to people waiting for treatment over the winter. On the graph a line has been added to show the underlying trend. This trend in median wait times from referral to decision to treat for admitted people has increased slightly by 0.5 weeks between December 2013 and December 2015; non-admitted pathways have increased by 0.4 weeks and incomplete pathways have increased by 0.4 weeks in the same time periods. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/rtt-waiting-times\/\">NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times<\/a>"}
