The percentage of patients finding it easy to get through to the GP surgery on the phone has risen from 65% (+\/- 0.6%) in 2009\/10 to 75% (+\/- 1.2%) in 2012\/13, although that was a drop of 3% on the previous year in 2011\/12. However, this means that approximately a quarter of patients still don't find it easy to get through on the phone.  Current figures from January to September 2013 suggest that this percentage hasn't changed significantly. <br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England,  GP Patient Survey"}
