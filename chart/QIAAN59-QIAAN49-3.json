The majority of respondents (80%) felt they received the right amount of information about their condition or treatment and this did not change significantly from 2005 to 2014. Over this period, one-fifth of respondents felt they did not receive enough information and 1% felt they received too much.  <br><br>The picture looks different in A&E, where 9% of respondents in 2015 said they were not given any information about their treatment or condition. This has decreased from 12% in 2005. 77% of respondents in A&E felt they had received the right amount of information, up from 74% in 2006 (Data not shown).<br><br>Updated August 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cqc.org.uk\/content\/adult-inpatient-survey-2015\">Care Quality Commission, Adult Inpatient Survey 2015<\/a>"}
