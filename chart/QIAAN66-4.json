Nearly every child in the world has been infected with rotavirus at least once by the age of five. Those that develop severe gastroenteritis become dehydrated, and require hospitalisation for rehydration. The national rotavirus vaccination programme started in July 2013 and is expected to prevent a significant number of young infants from developing this infection, thus preventing a significant number of admissions and rare deaths, as well as improving the herd immunity.<br><br>Since February 2014 the proportion of babies receiving the vaccine has been quite high - between 91.5 - 93.3% for the first dose and 86 - 88% for the second dose. Prior to this there was much lower coverage but this is mainly due to how the programme was rolled out. Despite the programme starting in July 2013 the first cohort of children aged 25 weeks (the age the vaccine is given at) to be routinely offered rotavirus vaccine alongside other primary vaccines were evaluated from January 2014. Before this they may have only been offered it alongside the other vaccines ad-hoc or at a separate time. Also babies in November 2013 were the first cohort eligible by age for the vaccine.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/publications\/rotavirus-immunisation-programme-vaccine-coverage-estimates\">Public Health England, Rotavirus immunisation programme <\/a>"}
