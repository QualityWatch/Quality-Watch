The vaccine protects against a group of viruses that have been linked to the development of cervical cancer in later life and hence it can help reduce the incidence of cervical cancer (note that not all cervical cancers are caused by HPV and so the vaccine does not result in immunity to cervical cancer, only to one of the potential causes). There is consistently higher uptake of the first dose than subsequent doses, and the third dose always has the lowest uptake. Over the last three data points, the uptake of first and second data doses has remained fairly static (approximately 90% and 89% coverage, respectively), but there has been larger variation in the percentage of 12 to13 year old girls receiving their third dose. Between September 2012 and May 2013, it actually drops to its lowest point of 72%, before it rises back to 81% in the next time period (although there is a slight overlap in the last two time periods).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England & Public Health England & Health & Social Care Information Centre"}
