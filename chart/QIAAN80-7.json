In mid 2007 the waiting list was large, with over 4 million people waiting for treatment. This was reduced drastically to under 2.5 million by winter 2009. We see a clear seasonal trend with the list being longer over the summer months and shorter in the winter. Despite these seasonal changes we see an overall upwards trend in the waiting list.
