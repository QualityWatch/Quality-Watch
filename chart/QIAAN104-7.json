In many of the other countries under analysis, the rate has also been stable. The UK’s performance relative to other countries appears good. However, Italy had just 2.7 amputations per 100,000 population in 2013. Evidence from England suggests that many of the amputations could still be prevented with targeted preventative services and fast access to high-quality foot care (Kerr, 2012). Also, multidisciplinary diabetic foot care teams improve outcomes and reduce costs to the NHS (Kerr, 2012). <br><br>It is important to be mindful of the differences in coding practices (e.g. major\/minor amputations) that are likely to have an impact on the observed differences between countries.
