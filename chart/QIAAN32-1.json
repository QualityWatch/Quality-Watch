Cervical cancer screening coverage, however, has been more variable. Coverage was steadily declining until 2008, when rates rose from 73% to a high of 76% in 2010. In 2008-09, Jade Goody, a TV celebrity, died an early death from cervical cancer. This led to an increase in awareness of cervical cancer screening by women, which may be responsible for the increase seen at that time. However this increase has not been sustained and rates have been falling since 2010. Only 73% of the eligible population were adequately screened in 2013.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, breast screening programme and cervical screening programme"}
