"analysis_commentary" : "<P>The coverage of breast cancer screening for eligible women has increased steadily over time and has been consistently around 77.0% since 2009. Cervical cancer screening coverage, however, has been more variable. Coverage was steadily declining until 2008, when rates rose from 72.5% to a high of 75.5% in 2010. In 2008-09, Jade Goody, a TV celebrity, died an early death from cervical cancer. This led to an increase in awareness of cervical cancer screening by women, which may be responsible for the increase seen at that time.</P>",
