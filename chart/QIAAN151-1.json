The rate has increased slightly from 6 admissions per 100 full term births in 2011 to 6.1 in 2012. While both these figures represent a substantial increase compare with the rate of 5.1 per 100 full term biths in 2010, that number was calcaulted based only on the 135 trusts that submitted data in 2010 - as opposed to 161 trusts submitting data in 2012 - so many not be directly comparable. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
