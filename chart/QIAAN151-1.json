The rate has increased slightly from 6 admissions per 100 full term births in 2011 to 6.1 in 2012. While both these figures represent a substantial increase compared with the rate of 5.1 per 100 full term briths in 2010, that number was calculated based only on the 135 trusts that submitted data in 2010 - as opposed to 161 trusts submitting data in 2012 - so many not be directly comparable. It is also important to note that some babies may be admitted to the paediatric unit rather than the neonatal unit, so these figures could be underestimating the true admission rate.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<br><br><a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/\">Department of Health, Outcomes Framework<\/a> "}
