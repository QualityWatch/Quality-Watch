A classical venous thrombosis is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which can break off (embolize), and become a life-threatening pulmonary embolism (PE). The disease process is therefore called venous thromboembolism (abbreviated as VTE). However, the risk of developing DVT is increased in certain circumstances experienced and seen in care settings such as inactivity, damaged blood vessels, certain medical conditions and associated interventions. In acute setting, incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) decreased from 1.5% of sampled patients in April 2012 to 0.8% of patients in March 2014.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, NHS Safety Thermometer"}
