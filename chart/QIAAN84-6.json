The number of delayed days for all patients decreased at the same time as the number of patients experiencing a delay has decreased. However, the total number of delayed days accrued in a month when the delay is attributable to NHS organisations has increased by approximately 19%. This is despite the decrease seen in the number of patients being delayed. This may be due to an increase in the number of patients experiencing a larger number of delayed days offsetting the overall decrease in numbers.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Delayed transfer of care"}
