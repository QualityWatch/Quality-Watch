It was fairly static between August 2010 and February 2015 and ranged between 27,654 and 40,036. However, after February 2015 the number of delayed days begins to increase at a far greater rate than it has done previously and over the next 10 months up to December 2015 this was an extra 14,705 days per month (a 42 per cent increase).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
