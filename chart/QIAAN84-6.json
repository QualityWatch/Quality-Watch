"analysis_commentary" : "<P>The length of delays that patients are likely to experience when social care organisations are responsible for the delay has improved over time. The number of delayed days for all patients decreased at the same time as the number of patients has decreased. However, the total number of delayed days accrued in a month when the delay is attributable to NHS organisations has increased by approximately 19%. This is despite the decrease seen in the number of patients being delayed. This may be due to an increase in the number of patients experiencing a larger number of delayed days offsetting the overall decrease in numbers.</P>",
