The increase was 44% for social care organisations and by 59% when both organisations are responsible. The total number of delayed days was fairly static between August 2010 and February 2015 and ranged between 27,654 and 40,036. However, after February 2015 the number of delayed days began to increase at a far greater rate than it had done previously. By April 2016 this was an extra 20,280 days per month (a 58% increase).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
