For varicose vein operations, the proportion of people reporting improvement almost doubled (five-year average 84%) when compared to EQ-VAS (five-year average 41%) and is also higher than for EQ-5D (five-year average 53%).  The proportion of people reporting improvement after hip and knee replacements is also highest for this measure. Overall, if a person was deciding to go for a varicose vein, hip or knee replacement surgery, they are very likely to undergo surgery based on these condition specific questionnaire results but certainly less likely to decide for a varicose vein surgery based on the previous two measures. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Patient Reported Outcome Measures, Health & Social Care Information Centre"}
