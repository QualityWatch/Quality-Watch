There has also been very little variation between different trust types. Staff in ambulance trusts reported a lower level of support from their managers. The difference is only approximately 0.5 points - on the 1-5 scale - lower than the national result. <br><br>There were no differences in reported satisfaction with the support staff received between the different staff groups we investigated (Medical\/dental staff;  Registered nurses;  Healthcare assistants;  Health visitors;  Social care staff;  AHP, Scientific & technical staff;  General managers;  Wider healthcare team, which includes administration\/central functions\/corporate\/maintenance) or staff characteristics (age, sex, disability and ethnicity - white vs. non-white).<br><br>The national report (see 'About this data' for more details) states that in 2015, 67% of staff were satisfied with the support that they received from their immediate manager.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">\"NHS England, NHS Staff Survey\"<\/a>"}
