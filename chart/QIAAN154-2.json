Only New Zealand had higher mortality rates. Sweden had the lowest rate of the comparator countries and Korea had the lowest of all the OECD countries. Admission-based haemorrhagic stroke, 30-day in-hospital mortality shows similar trends for the UK and was more or less stable at approximately 30 deaths per 100 hospital discharges between 2008 and 2011 (see Appendix 4). Sweden had the lowest rate of the comparator countries and Japan had the lowest of all the OECD countries. <br><br>A range of reports have highlighted problems in the delivery of acute care (e.g. Francis, 2013; Inquiry, Keogh Review, 2013). The trends described above may to some extent be capturing some of these deficiencies but the declines nevertheless offer a hopeful picture. It is also important to note that, overall, inaccuracies in routine data and differences in stroke care around the world make international comparisons very challenging.<br> <br>Since the 1990s, the Royal College of Physicians has carried out work to improve quality of care for patients who have had a stroke. Most recently it has set up the Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP), which aims to improve quality by auditing stroke services against evidence-based standards. Since December 2012, this audit collects data on a quarterly basis for every stroke patient in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, looking across the entire care pathway – acute care, rehabilitation, six-month follow-up and outcomes. The most recent audit reports highlight that there have been significant improvements in the organisation and provision of stroke care services. However, large unacceptable variations remain and not all patients have access to the same high-quality care (Royal College of Physicians, 2014a, 2014b). Variations are mainly in staff mix and skills (nurses, care assistants and consultants), access to clinical psychology and social care, stroke specific early supported discharge, organisation of stroke units, CCG involvement in services development and strategic planning. A Cochrane review of evidence suggests that stroke patients who receive organised inpatient care in dedicated stroke units are more likely to be alive and lead an independent life one year after a stroke (Stroke Unit Trialists’ Collaboration, 2013). <br><br>At the same time, a review by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (2013) on the quality of care received by patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage has provided a range of recommendations for improving the quality of care for haemorrhagic stroke. The report specifically highlights the importance of appropriate education for professionals about clinical presentation, establishing formal networks linking different levels of care, and introducing standard protocols of care at secondary and tertiary level.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
