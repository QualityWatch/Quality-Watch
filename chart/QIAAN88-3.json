There appears to be an inverse relationship between the total number of calls and the percentage that can be responded to within the eight minutes. Data was only plotted until March 2016, because after this, a number of trusts started a coding trial and are no longer included in the monthly number of calls. <br><br>However, the total number of calls does not appear to be the sole reason for the breach of the national standard in a given month, as breaches are not always associated with increased call activity and increased call activity doesn't always result in a breach. Although there could be a tipping point whereby, a volume of calls over 250,000 nationally leads to a national breach in the target.<br><br>Further investigation of what is happening to cause breaches would be needed, as it is not down solely to activity in response to ambulance calls that are classed as life-threatening.<br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
