There appears to be an inverse relationship between the total number of calls and the percentage that can be responded to within the eight minutes. Please note that data has not been analysed from April 2016 onwards. This is because as part of the Ambulance Response Programme several Ambulance Trusts took part in pilots which introduced new categories of calls, which are not comparable to Category A (Red 1 and Red 2) and so the number of Category A calls decreases as data collection for Category A calls ceased in those Trusts.

Although there could be a tipping point whereby, a volume of calls over 250,000 nationally leads to a national breach in the target.<br><br>Further investigation of what is happening to cause breaches would be needed, as it is not down solely to activity in response to ambulance calls that are classed as life-threatening.<br><br>Updated November 2017<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
