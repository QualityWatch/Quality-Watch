It is clear, however, that the vast majority of England's GP practices are performing well across the clinical disease areas, with little variation in QOF achievement scores over the last ten years. <br><br>Between 2006\/07 and 2016\/17 the achievement rates for depression, mental health and palliative care indicators were relatively low compared to the other clinical indicators. Cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis indicators  have also had lower achievement rates than other conditions since they were added as QOF clinical indicators. There was a noticeable drop in performance of the learning disabilities indicator, from 99.2% in 2010\/11 to 83.5% in 2011\/12, although this has since recovered to 99.0% in 2016\/17.<br><br>In 2012\/13, average QOF achievement across all indicators fell for the first time in three years with decreases reported across the majority of clinical indicator groups (data not shown). NHS Digital suggested this may have been partly due to the addition of two new disease areas (peripheral arterial disease and osteoporosis) to the clinical domain. The average achievement score across all practices in England fell again from 96.7% in 2012\/13 to 92.4% in 2013\/14, although achievement has since improved to 95.5% in 2016\/17.<br><br>Updated December 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB30124\">NHS Digital, Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF)<\/a> "}
