It is clear, however, that  the vast majority of England's GP practices are performing well across the disease management areas, with little variation  in performance level in the last six years. In 20011/12, the average national performance across domain areas (unweighted) is 96.0%, although there are a couple of conditions where performance against the metrics is relatively lower (depression averages 86.5% over the last six years and palliative care 91.5%). There is also a noticeable drop in the achievement against the learning disabilities indicator group between 2010/11 and 2011/12, from 99.2% to 83.5%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health and Social Care Information Centre, Quality and Outcomes Framework"}
