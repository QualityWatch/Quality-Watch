It is clear, however, that  the vast majority of England's GP practices are performing well across the disease management areas, with little variation  in performance level in the last ten years. Between 2006\/07 and 2015\/16 the performance of depression and palliative care against the metrics is relatively low versus other conditions. There is also a noticeable drop in the achievement against the learning disabilities indicator group between 2010\/11 and 2011\/12, from 99.2% to 83.5%, though this has since recovered to 99.7% in 2015\/16 . In 2012\/13, however, average QOF performance fell for the first time in three years with decreases reported across the majority of clinical indicator groups - NHS Digital has suggested this may have been partly due to the addition of two new disease areas (peripheral arterial disease and osteoporosis) to the clinical domain. The average achievement score across all practices in England fell again between 2012\/13 and 2013\/14 from 96.7% of the total points available to 92.4%, though average achievement has improved to 95.2% in 2015\/16.<br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.content.digital.nhs.uk\/catalogue\/PUB22266\">NHS Digital, Quality and Outcomes Framework<\/a> "}
