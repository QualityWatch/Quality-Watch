However, this was not as great a difference when looking at general managers; across the years, 20% more staff in this group reported working extra hours when compared to national results.<br><br>There was also variation in staff reporting working extra hours based on staff characteristics. A higher percentage of male staff reported working extra hours than females, this ranged between 4% and 7% greater than what is reported nationally in each year (data not shown). Also there was a consistent difference in how many staff report working extra hours based on staff age. Less 16 to 30 year olds (on average across all years 3% less) and more 41 to 50 year olds (on average across all years 5% more) report working extra hours compared to the national average (data not shown).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS Staff"}
