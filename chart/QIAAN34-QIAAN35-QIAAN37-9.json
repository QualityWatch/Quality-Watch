General managers were the most likely to work extra hours and 29% more staff in this group reported working extra hours than the national average.<br><br>There was also variation in staff reporting working extra hours based on staff characteristics. More male staff reported working extra hours than females, this ranged between 4 and 7 percentage points greater than what is reported nationally in each year (data not shown). Also, there is a consistent difference in how many staff report working extra hours based on staff age. Fewer 16 to 30 year olds (3% less on average across all years) and more 41 to 50 year olds (3.5 percentage points more on average across all years) report working extra hours compared to the number of staff reporting nationally (data not shown). <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
