However, this is not as great a difference when looking at general managers; across the years 20% more staff in this group report working extra hours when compared to national results.<br><br>There was also variation in staff reporting working extra hours based on staff characteristics. More male staff reported working extra hours than females, this ranged between 4% and 7% greater than what is reported nationally in each year (data not shown). Also there is a consistent difference in how many staff report working extra hours based on staff age. Less 16 to 30 year olds (on average across all years 3% less ) and more 41 to 50 year olds (on average across all years 3.5% more ) report working extra hours compared to looking at the number of staff reporting nationally (data not shown). <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1006\/Latest-Results\/2014-Results\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
