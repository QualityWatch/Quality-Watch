The data is shown for 2012\/13 and excludes private treatment. It can be seen that there are similar rates of operations for deciles 3 to 10, with the two most deprived deciles showing lower rates of treatment than the others (although the difference is not as large as that observed for hip replacements). Some studies suggest that the need for hernia surgery is greater in more deprived areas but the finding here may suggest that patients in more deprived areas are having different patterns of treatment for these procedures than the rest of the country. Between 2003\/04 and 2012\/13 the rates of inguinal hernia repair fell, although the most deprived decile have consistently had lower rates of hernia repair over this period (data not shown).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics"}
