Anti-cancer drug regimes have the highest proportions of people receiving their first treatments within 31 days for all time periods. This proportion has increased very slightly over time with a high of 99.8% seen in several time points. The proportion of people having surgery within 31 days of the decision to treat is lower overall and is more variable over the time period. Despite this, it has increased over time and from Quarter 1 2011\/12 it has remained above 97.0%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
