It is common for cancer patients to need more than one treatment, which could be a combination of several episodes of one type of treatment, or a combination of multiple types. <br><br>For all cancer treatment types, the proportion of people receiving their first treatment within 31 days was consistently high at 98.0% or greater, until Q4 2013\/14, when it started to fall. The operational standard for this measure is that 96% of patients receive their first treatment within 31 days; this has been comfortably met in every quarter since 2008\/9.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics?s=Provider-based+Cancer+Waiting+Times&site=\">NHS England, Cancer waiting times<\/a>"}
