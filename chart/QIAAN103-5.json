This chart shows how long patients wait between arriving in A&E and their treatment beginning (in whatever form that takes).  People's average experience (the median) has changed little since 2011 and stands at around 50 minutes.  Interestingly, the 95% percentile value - that is, waiting times for some of the patients that wait the longest - has fallen slightly over time, from 195 minutes in May 2011 to 180 minutes in March 2014.  It's worth noting that this measure can be sensitive to data quality issues.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
