This chart shows how long patients wait between arriving in A&E and their treatment beginning (in whatever form that takes). People's average experience (the median) has changed little since 2011 and ranges between a minimum of 46 minutes to a maximum of 65 minutes. Interestingly, the 95th percentile value - that is, waiting times for some of the patients that wait the longest - had fallen slightly, from 195 minutes in May 2011 to 181 minutes in July 2015.
