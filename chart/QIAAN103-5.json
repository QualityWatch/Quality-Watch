This chart shows how long patients wait between arriving in A&E and their treatment beginning (in whatever form that takes). People's average experience (the median) has changed little since 2011 and ranges between a minimum of 46 minutes to a maximum of 65 minutes. Interestingly, the 95th percentile value - that is, waiting times for some of the patients that wait the longest - had fallen slightly, from 195 minutes in May 2011 to 181 minutes in July 2015. However, it has since increased back up to levels similar to May 2011 - 217 minutes in February 2016. It's worth noting that this measure can be sensitive to data quality issues.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=title%3a%22Accident+and+Emergency+Quality+Indicator%22&sort=Most+recent&size=10&page=1#top\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
