This chart shows how long patients wait between arriving in A&E and their treatment beginning (in whatever form that takes). The median has changed little since 2011 and ranges between a low of 46 minutes in January 2015 to a high of 69 minutes in March 2016. Interestingly, the 95th percentile value - that is, waiting times for some of the patients that wait the longest - had fallen slightly, from 195 minutes in May 2011 to 181 minutes in July 2015.
