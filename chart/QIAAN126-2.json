The data does not include information on privately funded social care, or children's social services. For more information on this data please see 'about this data' below. <br><br>For professional staff (which include social workers, occupational therapists, registered nurses and allied health professionals), the percentage change increases by 3% from 2011 to 2013 but then decreases in 2014 by 2%. They were the smallest group from 2011 to 2013 but in 2014 the managers, supervisors group became the smallest. This group decreased in size by 22% from 2011 to 2014. The other two groups have also decreased: other staff (which includes roles not directly involved in providing care and support, such as HR and IT) by 19%; and direct care (which includes all roles which provide care or support directly, such as care workers and support workers) decreased by 27% in three years. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments"}
