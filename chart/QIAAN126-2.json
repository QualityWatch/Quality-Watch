The data does not include information on privately funded social care, or children's social services. For more information on this data please see 'about this data' below. <br><br>For the smallest group, professional staff (which include social workers, occupational therapists, registered nurses and allied health professionals), the percentage change increases by 3% from 2011 to 2013; this is the only group who experience an increase. Their numbers remained fairly consistent however (just under 20,000) over the three years. The other three, larger groups have decreased: managers, supervisors by 13%; other staff (which includes roles not directly involved in providing care and support, such as HR and IT) by 14%; and direct care (which includes all roles which provide care or support directly, such as care workers and support workers) decreased by 18% in two years. The total number of whole time equivalents for all staff groups has also decreased by around 14,000 from 2011 to 2013.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Social Services: Staff of Social Services Departments"}
