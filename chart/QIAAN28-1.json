The Stop Smoking Services is judged by the number of people who quit smoking within a certain time period. <br><br>The highest proportion of quitters was seen in 2003\/04, when 57% of people who set a quit date quit smoking within four weeks. In 2003\/04, the Department of Health's first integrated smoking campaign launched, which included the first campaigns designed to be highly emotional, which may have been responsible (http:\/\/smokefree.nhs.uk\/resources\/campaign\/). Since then, the proportion of quitters has steadily declined to the lowest level of 49% in 2009\/10, where it has since remained. However, the number of people setting a quit date as part of the NHS Stop Smoking Scheme has been increasing, from around 230,000 in 2001\/02 to a high of roughly 820,000 in 2011\/12. The net result is that more people are reporting quitting after four weeks. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Statistics on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England"}
