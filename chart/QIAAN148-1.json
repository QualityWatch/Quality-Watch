It is recommended that primary PCI should be performed within 90 minutes of arrival to hospital (door-to-balloon time) and within 150 minutes of a patient's call for help (call-to-balloon) time. Results show that over time there has been an increase in the proportion of patients receiving primary PCI within 90 minutes of arrival at the heart attack centre. Call-to-balloon time can either be assessed against 150 minutes or 120 minutes (according to European guidelines-see Audit).  Over time the proportion of patients admitted directly to a heart attack centre and receiving primary PCI within 150 minutes from the moment the patient made the call has stabilised around 90% but is just over 60% when assessed against the 120minutes (data not presented - see Audit).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hqip.org.uk\/national-programmes\/a-z-of-nca\/heart-myocardial-ischaemia-heart-attack-or-minap\/\">HQIP, National Institute of Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, The British Cardiovascular Society<\/a>"}
