This finding is consistent with outher studies, which have suggested that the association between socio-economic deprivation and hosptial admissions for falls is cause by patients in more deprived areas tending to have  lower resilence to falls (either by multiple co-morbidity or a poor living environment\/social support network), making admission to hospital more likely (West and others, Public Health 2006).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
