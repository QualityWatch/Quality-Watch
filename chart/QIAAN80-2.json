In mid-2007, the treatment waiting list contained over 4 million people, but this was reduced drastically to fewer than 2.5 million by winter 2009. Since then, we see clear seasonal trends with the list growing over the summer months and shrinking in the winter. Beyond these seasonal changes there has been an overall upwards trend in the number of people on the waiting list. Since April 2015, there have been more than 3 million people waiting for treatment each month.
