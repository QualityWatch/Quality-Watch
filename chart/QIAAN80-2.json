This trend in median wait times from referral to decision to treat for admitted people has increased slightly since February 2012. For people who are not admitted for treatment, the median wait time has also been increasing, from 3.6 weeks in February 2012, to 5.1 weeks in November 2013. <br><br>Since April 2013, a zero-tolerance policy was introduced for anyone waiting over 52 weeks for treatment. From this date, trusts would be fined Â£5,000 per breach. The introduction of this policy broadly coincides with the increase in the median we see here for non-admitted pathways. A National Audit Office (NAO) report, published in January 2014, suggests that '[this] may mean that newer referrals are waiting longer as trusts deal with patients towards the end of the 18-week period, or who have already waited longer than 18 weeks' (Department of Health, 2013). <http:\/\/www.nao.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/NHS-waiting-times-for-elective-care-in-England.pdf> We can explore this impact further in the next charts.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
