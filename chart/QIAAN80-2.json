On the graph a line has been added to show the underlying trend. This trend in median wait times from referral to decision to treat for admitted people has increased slightly by 0.4 weeks since July 2012, and incomplete pathways has increased by 0.3 weeks. For people who are not admitted for treatment, the median wait time has also been increasing, from 4.1 weeks in July 2012, to 5.2 weeks in July 2014. <br><br>Since April 2013, a zero-tolerance policy has been in place for anyone waiting over 52 weeks for treatment. From this date, trusts would be fined Â£5,000 per breach. The introduction of this policy broadly coincides with the increase in the median wait we see here for non-admitted pathways. A National Audit Office report, published in January 2014, suggests that '[this] may mean that newer referrals are waiting longer as trusts deal with patients towards the end of the 18-week period, or who have already waited longer than 18 weeks' (Department of Health, 2013). <http:\/\/www.nao.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/NHS-waiting-times-for-elective-care-in-England.pdf> We explore this impact further in the next charts.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Referral to Treatment waiting times"}
