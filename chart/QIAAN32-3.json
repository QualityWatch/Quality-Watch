Please note, these data do not adjust for how frequently different age groups should be tested. Therefore, it can't be directly compared to previous charts but we can look at the invite trends in isolation, which you expect would be consistent over time. <br><br>As expected, as the population grows the number of women eligible for testing grows in each age group (data not shown). However, the number invited has remained level or has decreased between 2005 and 2013. The proportion of eligible women aged 25 to 49 invited has generally increased and was at a high of 39% in 2012. However, this dipped to 35% in 2013. The proportion of women aged 50 to 64 invited had been decreasing since the high of 30% seen in 2005. After a low of 16% in 2009 this decline reversed and the proportions of invites began to increase again but in 2013 this had not returned to the same levels observed in 2005 and was 9% lower at just 21%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, breast screening programme and cervical screening programme"}
