Please note, these data do not adjust for how frequently different age groups should be tested. Therefore, it can't be directly compared to previous charts. <br><br>The proportion of eligible women aged 25 to 49 invited has generally increased and was at a high of 39% in 2012. However, this dipped to 35% in 2013. In contrast, the proportion of women aged 50 to 64 invited had been decreasing since the high of 30% seen in 2005. After a low of 16% in 2009 this decline reversed and the proportions of invites began to increase again but in 2013 though this had not returned to the same levels observed in 2005 and was 9% lower at just 21%. So in 2013 there was a lower proportion of women aged 50-64 invited for screening.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, breast screening programme and cervical screening programme"}
