The chart above compares the number of people waiting over four hours by week of the year. For the first 16 weeks of the year (January to April), the proportion of patients waiting more than four hours in A&E was 75% higher in 2013 compared to 2012, and 137% higher than in 2011. The differences later in the year were much less marked. There are a number of potential explanations for the additional breaches centred on the first weeks of the year in 2013. These include the effects of bad weather in terms of demand for A&E, as well as possible consequences of the roll-out of the NHS 111 urgent care phone service.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
