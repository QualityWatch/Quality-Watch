There is a general trend for performance to be higher in the summer, despite the fact that A&E sees the highest numbers of attendees at this time. This is explained by changes in the case-mix of people attending. In summer A&E sees a higher proportion of cuts and sprains, most of which can be treated relatively quickly. In winter there is a larger proportion of older people attending and a greater number of people requiring emergency admission to hospital.<br><br>Drops in performance are normally observed from November in any given financial year. Performance generally recovers by April the following year.<br><br>On the whole, there has been a year-on-year decrease in the proportion of patients attending major A&E departments that are admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours. 2017\/18 followed a similar trajectory to 2016\/17 until December 2017 when performance worsened. Unlike 2016\/17, there was no recovery in February or March, and performance against the four-hour target continued to decrease before reaching an all time low of 76.4% in March 2018.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
