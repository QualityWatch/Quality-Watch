There is a general trend for performance to be higher in the summer, despite the fact that A&E sees the highest numbers of attendees at this time. This is explained by changes in the case-mix of people attending. In summer A&E sees a higher proportion of cuts and sprains, most of which can be treated relatively quickly. <br><br>Drops in performance are normally observed from November in any given financial year. Performance generally recovers by April of that year. <br><br>On the whole, there is a year-on-year (apart from between 2012\/13 and 2013\/14) decrease in the proportion of patients seen within four hours, similar to what was observed in the previous chart. 2015\/16 began with a particularly low level of performance, with only 90% of patients seen within four hours, but it began to pick up as the year continued up until July 2015. After this it began to decrease again and in March 2016 had dropped to 81%, the lowest level of any given month at that time. 2016\/17 has had performance lower than all other years to date, the latest data shows performance of 81% in February 2017.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
