The chart above compares the number of people waiting over four hours by week of the year. For the first 16 weeks of the year, the proportion of patients waiting more than four hours for a bed following a decision to admit was 75% higher in 2013 compared to 2012, and 137% higher than in 2011. There are a number of potential explanations for this including: bad weather, increased complexity of patients, possible staff shortages and disruptions caused by the roll-out of the NHS 111 urgent care phone service. After April 2013 there was a slightly higher proportion of patients waiting more than four hours for a bed compared with the same period in previous years (13% higher in 2013 compared with 2012, and 33% higher in 2013 compared with 2011), but the difference is much less stark than the start of 2013.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
