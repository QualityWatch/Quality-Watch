There is a general trend for performance to be higher in the summer, despite the fact that A&E sees the highest numbers of attendees at this time. This is explained by changes in the case-mix of people attending. In summer A&E sees a higher proportion of cuts and sprains, most of which can be treated relatively quickly. <br><br>Drops in performance are normally observed from November in any given financial year; however there is variation between the years in what happens subsequently. In 2010\/11 and 2014\/15 it reached a low level of performance in December but then started to recover in the months after. In 2011\/12 and 2013\/14 the level of performance continued to drop until February, after which there was some recovery. In 2012\/13 there didn't appear to be any recovery until well into the next financial year (May 2013\/14). <br><br>On the whole, there is a year-on-year (apart from between 2012\/13 and 2013\/14) decrease in the proportion of patients seen within 4 hours, similar to what was observed in the previous chart. 2015\/16 began with a particularly low level of performance, with only 90% of patients seen within 4 hours, but it began to pick up as the year continued up until July 2015. Subsequent to this it began to decrease again and in January 2016 had dropped to 83%, the lowest level of any given month.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
