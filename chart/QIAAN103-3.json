This chart shows weekly performance for major A&E units indexed to the start of the calendar year - so week 1 to 4 are January, weeks 5 to 8 are February and so on.  There is a general trend for performance to be higher in the summer - despite the fact that A&E sees the highest numbers of attendees at this time.  This is explained by changes in the case-mix of people attending.  In summer A&E sees a higher proportion of cuts and sprains, most of which can be treated relatively quickly.  A large dip in performance can be seen in the first 18 weeks of 2013. Performance trends appear more consistent towards the second-half of the year, although the 2014 data has yet to join the established trend.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
