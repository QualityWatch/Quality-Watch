There is a general trend for performance to be higher in the summer, despite the fact that A&E sees the highest numbers of attendees at this time. This is explained by changes in the case-mix of people attending. In summer A&E sees a higher proportion of cuts and sprains, most of which can be treated relatively quickly. In winter there is a larger proportion of older people attending and a greater number of people requiring emergency admission to hospital.<br><br>Drops in performance are normally observed from November in any given financial year. Performance generally recovers by April the following year. <br><br>On the whole, there is a year-on-year decrease in the proportion of patients seen in type 1 A&E departments within four hours. 2016\/17 began with a particularly low level of performance, with only 85% of patients seen within four hours, and this only improved slightly over the summer. In January 2017 performance dropped to 78%, an all-time low since the introduction of the four-hour target. The latest data for 2017\/18 shows performance following a similar trajectory to 2016\/17, reaching 85% in October 2017.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
