There are a number of potential explanations for this including: bad weather, increased complexity of patients, possible staff shortages and disruptions caused by the roll-out of the NHS 111 urgent care phone service. After April 2013 there was a slightly higher proportion of patients waiting more than four hours for a bed compared with the same period in previous years (13% higher in 2013 compared with 2012, and 33% higher in 2013 compared with 2011), but the difference is much less stark than the start of 2013<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
