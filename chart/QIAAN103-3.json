This chart shows weekly performance for major A&E units indexed to the start of the calendar year - so weeks 1 to 4 are January, weeks 5 to 8 are February and so on. There is a general trend for performance to be higher in the summer - despite the fact that A&E sees the highest numbers of attendees at this time. This is explained by changes in the case-mix of people attending. In summer A&E sees a higher proportion of cuts and sprains, most of which can be treated relatively quickly. A large dip in performance can be seen in the first 18 weeks of 2013. Performance trends appear more consistent towards the second-half of the year, although the 2014 data does not achieve a similar level and in fact declines dramatically towards the end of the year. 2015 begins with a particularly low level of performance, with only 80% of patients seen within 4 hours in the first week of the year. Performance does, however, pick up as the year continues, although the performance levels do not match those of 2011, 2012 and 2013.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
