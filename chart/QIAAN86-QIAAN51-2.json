","analysis_commentary" : "<P>Starting in 2012, inpatients were asked to rate their overall care experience on a zero to 10 scale (0 being a poor experience and 10 a very good experience). Similar to 2012, in 2013, 87% of inpatients rated their care with a score of six or above, although there was an increase in the proportion of patients reporting the highest levels of satisfaction, with 48% giving either a 9 or 10 rating. This can be compared to the 43% of patients who rated the care they received as 'Excellent' in 2011. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients"}
