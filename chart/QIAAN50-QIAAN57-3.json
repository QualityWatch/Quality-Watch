For inpatients the proportion who always felt they were given enough privacy has been around 90% since 2005 and those who felt they were sometimes given enough privacy has been around 10%. For those seen in A&E there has been more variation. For those who definitely felt they had enough privacy, this ranged from 79% in 2005 to a low of 74% in 2010 and was 78% in 2013. These changes were reflected in the proportion feeling they had enough privacy 'to some extent' with the proportion answering 'no' remaining steady at 2%.<br><br>While the answer categories are slightly different for each question it is interesting to note that those who were seen in A&E responded more negatively compared to inpatients. With the proportion feeling they definitely had enough privacy being on average 12% lower for those in A&E compared to inpatients.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients and Survey of Outpatients"}
