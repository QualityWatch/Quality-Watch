For inpatients, the proportion who always felt they were given enough privacy has increased from 88% in 2005 to 91% in 2015. There was more variation for those seen in A&E. The proportion who felt they had definitely been given enough privacy decreased from 81% in 2005 to a low of 75% in 2010 and has since increased to 79% in 2015. Each year, 2% of respondents said they did not receive enough privacy.  <br><br>While the answer categories are slightly different for each question it is interesting to note that those who were seen in A&E responded more negatively compared to inpatients. With the proportion feeling they definitely had enough privacy being on average 12% lower for those in A&E compared to inpatients.<br><br>Updated August 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cqc.org.uk\/content\/adult-inpatient-survey-2015\">Care Quality Commission, Adult Inpatient Survey 2015<\/a>"}
