However the rate of decline has slowed from 2013 to 2014, but it is too early to state if this reflects a true change in late diagnoses.<br><br>For the UK overall, figures show a similar decline over the period 2005 to 2014 and this is mostly attributable to reductions in late diagnoses among MSM (from 42% in 2009 to 29% in 2014) with a smaller decline among heterosexual men (70% to 61%) and women (61% to 52%); whereas the proportion diagnosed late amongst injecting drug user increased from 55% to 65% over the same period. Although MSM are the highest absolute number of people diagnosed late, newly diagnosed at a late stage of infection remains a significant concern among heterosexuals and disproportionately amongst black Africans.     <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/hiv-data-tables\">Public Health England, HIV data tables<\/a>"}
