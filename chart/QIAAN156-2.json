However the rate of decline has slowed from 2013 to 2015, but it is too early to state if this reflects a true change in late diagnoses. For England, figures show a similar decline over the period 2005 to 2014. <br><br>The decline is mostly attributable to reductions in late diagnoses among MSM (from 42% in 2006 to 30% in 2015) with a smaller decline among heterosexual men (67% to 55%) and women (64% to 49%). Although MSM are the highest absolute number of people diagnosed late, newly diagnosed at a late stage of infection remains a significant concern among heterosexuals and disproportionately amongst black Africans.     <br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/hiv-data-tables\">Public Health England, HIV data tables<\/a>"}
