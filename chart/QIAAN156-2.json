However, the rate of decline has slowed since 2013, with the proportion of late HIV diagnoses fluctuating at around 42%. For England, figures show a similar decline over the period 2007 to 2013.<br><br>The decline is mostly attributable to reductions in late HIV diagnoses among MSM (from 42% in 2007 to 32% in 2016) with a smaller decline among heterosexual men (67% to 60%) and women (59% to 47%). Although MSM have the highest absolute number of people diagnosed late, new HIV cases which are diagnosed at a late stage of infection remains a significant concern among heterosexuals and disproportionately amongst black Africans.     <br><br>Updated January 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/statistics\/hiv-data-tables\">Public Health England, HIV: annual data tables<\/a>"}
