Between 2008 and 2013, 30-day mortality after admission to hospital for AMI (based on patient data) in the UK declined from 12 per 100 patients in 2008 to 9.1 per 100 in 2013. Thirty-day mortality (based on admission data) in the UK also declined, from 9.4 per 100 in 2008 to 7.6 per 100 in 2013. <br> <br>While not directly comparable with these OECD AMI indicators, a report from the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) showed there was a decline between 2003–04 and 2011–14 in same-hospital 30-day mortality rates (National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research, 2014). This finding suggests there have been significant improvements in the care provided to patients who have had a heart attack. However, the same report also expresses reservations about using unadjusted health outcome indicators to measure quality of care and conduct international comparisons of outcomes – due to differences in data collection, definitions and patient characteristics. <br><br>Updated January 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/stats.oecd.org\/index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_STAT#\">OECD, Health Care Quality Indicators, Acute Care<\/a>"}
