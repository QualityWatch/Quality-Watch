Looking at the longer term trend we can see that since Q1 2012\/13 the proportion has declined from 97.2% to 94.6% in Q1 2015\/16, with the lowest point (92.3%) in 2014\/15 Q1. <br><br>The total number of people who had an urgent referral for suspected breast cancer has been increasing over time and is at its highest of 76,000 in 2015\/16 Q1. The number of these cases being seen within 2 weeks is also increasing in parallel, but overall a smaller proportion is being seen within 2 weeks in Q1 2015\/16 than the previous two quarters.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
