Looking at the longer term trend we can see that between Q1 2012\/13 and Q1 2015\/16 the proportion has declined from 97.2% to 94.6% in Q1 2015\/16, with the lowest point (92.3%) in Q1 2014\/15. <br><br>The total number of people who had an urgent referral for suspected breast cancer has been increasing over time and was at its highest of 80,572 in Q3 2015\/16. The number of these cases being seen within 2 weeks is also increasing in parallel, but there has been variation in the proportion being seen within 2 weeks.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics?s=Provider-based+Cancer+Waiting+Times&site=\">NHS England, Cancer waiting times<\/a>"}
