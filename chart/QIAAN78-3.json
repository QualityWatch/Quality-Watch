Looking at the longer term trend we can see that this has been steadily declining since 2013\/14 Q3 and was at its lowest point (92.3%) in 2014\/15 Q1. <br><br>The total number of people who had an urgent referral for suspected breast cancer has also increased over time and was at its highest of nearly 72,000 in 2014\/15 Q1. However, the number of these cases being seen within 2 weeks has actually decreased in 2014\/15 Q1 compared to the previous quarter. Combined, these would explain the decrease in proportion we see here. The number of referrals have increased and the number seen within 2 weeks has not increased to match this.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancer waiting times"}
