In particular, having been broadly constant for the previous six years, in 2011\/12 the proportion for nurses dropped from 23% to 19%, and fell from 26% to 24% for doctors. Despite this recent improvement, there still remains a large proportion of patients who felt that staff talked about them as if they were not there. There is, therefore, potentially large scope for improvement in this area of patient experience.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients "}
