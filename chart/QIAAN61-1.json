Having been broadly constant for the six years, the proportion of patients who felt ignored began to decrease from 2011\/12 when the proportion for nurses dropped from 22% to 19%, and from 27% to 24% for doctors. This stayed constant for 3 years and dropped further to 18% for nurses and 22% for doctors in 2015, with an increased sample size.  Despite this recent improvement, there remains a proportion of patients who felt that staff talked about them as if they were not there. There is thus potentially still scope for improvement in this area of patient experience.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cqc.org.uk\/content\/adult-inpatient-survey-2015\"> Care Quality Commission, Adult Inpatient Survey<\/a>"}
