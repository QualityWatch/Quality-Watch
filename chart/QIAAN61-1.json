In particular, having been broadly constant for the previous six years, in 2011\/12 the proportion for nurses dropped from 23% to 19%, and fell from 26% to 24% for doctors. These levels have remained constant in 2013. Despite this recent improvement, there still remains a proportion of patients who felt that staff talked about them as if they were not there. There is, therefore, potentially still scope for improvement in this area of patient experience.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients "}
