The proportion responding 'yes' has also changed very little, with roughly 16% reporting they had their appointment date changed once in all years and around 3% reporting it had changed 2 or 3 times. Nobody in any year reported their appointment time had changed 4 times or more. <br><br>Although it is difficult to compare these results directly to the data above, despite seeing small positive changes in the proportion of cancelled operations and those not treated within 28 days of a cancelled operation, we don't see any reflection of this in the Adult Inpatient Survey, with patients reporting a similar experience in 2013 as 2005.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients and Survey of Outpatients"}
