The proportion responding that they did have their admission date altered has also changed very little. In 2014 16 per cent reported that they had their appointment date changed once and 4 per cent reported it had changed 2 or 3 times. Nobody in any year reported their appointment time had changed 4 times or more. <br><br>It is difficult to compare these results directly to the NHS England cancelled operations data presented above. Despite seeing positive changes in the proportion of cancelled operations and those not treated within 28 days of a cancelled operation, we don't see any reflection of this in the Adult Inpatient Survey data, with patients reporting a similar experience in 2014 as 2005.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cqc.org.uk\/content\/inpatient-survey-2014\">Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients<\/a>"}
