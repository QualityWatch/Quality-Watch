The proportion responding that they did have their admission date altered has also changed very little. In 2015, 17% reported that they had their appointment date changed once and 4% reported it had changed two or three times. In any year, 0.3% reported their appointment time had changed four times or more. <br><br>It is difficult to compare these results directly to the NHS England cancelled operations data presented above.
