In 2016, the UK outspent Italy, Spain and Portugal, but underspent France, Germany and Sweden. Since 1998, Luxembourg has spent more on health than the other EU15 countries, spending $7,463 per capita in 2016.<br><br>Health expenditure per capita in the UK increased steadily between 1999 and 2009, with an average year-on-year increase of $150, after which the rate of increase slowed until 2012. Between 2012 and 2013, UK health expenditure per capita jumped from $3,177 to $3,845 - but this should be treated with caution, as it does not represent a real increase. In fact it reflects the UK's adoption of the OECD's most recent system of health accounts. A similar jump in health expenditure per capita can be seen for Sweden between 2010 and 2011.<br><br>Since 2013, UK health spending has increased year-on-year at a relatively slow rate, reaching an estimated $4,192 per capita in 2016. The rate of increase in health expenditure has also slowed in other European countries including France, Belgium and the Netherlands, although rates of increase have remained steady in Germany and Denmark.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/data.oecd.org\/healthres\/health-spending.htm\">The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Data, Health spending<\/a>"}
