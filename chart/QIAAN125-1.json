This care can include help getting to bed, dressing or bathing. Here we look at the proportion of adult social care that was spent to support people living in their own homes. We can see that the proportion of money spent by councils for home care has been fairly steady since 1994-05, with an yearly average of 17.6%. However there has been some variation since 1994-95; it dipped to a low of 15.9% in 2002-03 and climbed to a high of 19.0% in 2010-11, since then it has been decreasing. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB16111\">Health & social care information centre, Personal Social Services Expenditure and Unit Costs<\/a>"}
