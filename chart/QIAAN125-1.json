This care can include help getting to bed, dressing or bathing. Here we look at the proportion and amount of adult social care that was spent to support people living in their own homes. From 2003-04, additional funding was made available from the Supporting People grant. Most of this was treated as housing expenditure but some is included in this social services expenditure data. In order to make this data more comparable over the longer term, we have chosen to exclude these support costs. You can read more about the Supporting People Programme here: <http:\/\/www.publications.parliament.uk\/pa\/cm200809\/cmselect\/cmcomloc\/649\/649i.pdf>. <br><br>We can see that the proportion of money spent by councils for home care has been fairly steady since 1994-05, around 17.6%. However there has been some variation since 1994-95; it dipped to a low of 15.9% in 2002-03 and climbed to a high of 19.0% in 2010-11, since then it has been decreasing. The absolute amount spent on homecare has increased over time, this was around £1.0 billion in 1994-95 and increased to a high of £3.1 billion in 2010-11. Since then this has decreased to £2.9 billion in 2012-13.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & social care information centre, Personal Social Services Expenditure and Unit Costs"}
