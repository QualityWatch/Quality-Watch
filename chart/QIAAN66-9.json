As mentioned earlier, this was because the safety of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine was questioned. From 2004, vaccination rates started to improve again, reaching  95 per cent in 2013, meeting the 95 per cent recommended WHO coverage target. In 2013, Greece – together with several other OECD countries (e.g. the Czech Republic, Hungary and Korea) – reached a coverage of 99 per cent, followed by Portugal (98 per cent) and Sweden (97 per cent). <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
