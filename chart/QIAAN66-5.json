The vaccine protects against a group of viruses that have been linked to the development of cervical cancer in later life and hence it can help reduce the incidence of cervical cancer (note that not all cervical cancers are caused by HPV and so the vaccine does not result in immunity to cervical cancer, only to one of the potential causes).<br><br>There is consistently higher uptake of the first dose than subsequent doses in the England. Uptake of the doses of the HPV vaccination in England has remained fairly static since 2010\/11. Between 2008\/09 and 2015\/16 average uptake of the first dose was 91% and 90% for the second dose. <br><br>In 2015\/16 uptake of the first dose was similar across all nations of the UK. There was slightly more variation in terms of the uptake of the two doses, for example Northern Ireland is the only nation with coverage above 90%, versus the UK average of 85%.<br><br>It is important to note that the vaccine coverage data collected from 2014\/15 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes to the HPV schedule from three doses to two in September 2014.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/search?q=Annual+HPV+vaccine\">Public Health England, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Coverage<\/a>"}
