The vaccine protects against a group of viruses which have been linked to the development of cervical cancer. Note that not all cervical cancers are caused by HPV and so the vaccine does not result in immunity to cervical cancer, only to one of its potential causes.<br><br>There has been a consistently higher uptake of the first dose than subsequent doses over time in England. Uptake for the HPV vaccination remained fairly static between 2011\/12 and 2013\/14, with an average uptake of 91% for the first dose and 89% for two doses. By 2016\/17, uptake had declined slightly, with an uptake of 89% for the first dose and 83% for two doses.<br><br>It is important to note that the vaccine coverage data collected from 2014\/15 onwards are not directly comparable to previous years due to changes to the HPV schedule from three doses to two in September 2014.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/search?q=Annual+HPV+vaccine\">Public Health England, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Coverage<\/a>"}
