The vaccine protects against a group of viruses that have been linked to the development of cervical cancer in later life and hence it can help reduce the incidence of cervical cancer (note that not all cervical cancers are caused by HPV and so the vaccine does not result in immunity to cervical cancer, only to one of the potential causes).<br><br>There is consistently higher uptake of the first dose than subsequent doses, and the third dose always has the lowest uptake. Over the last three years measured the uptake of all three doses in England has remained fairly static, averaging 91% for the first dose, 90% for the second dose and 87% for the third dose. There are similar patterns of vaccination coverage across all four nations of the United Kingdom, apart from the third dose which drops down to 81% in Scotland and as low as 77% in Wales.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/412264\/HPV_Vaccine_Coverage_in_England_200809_to_201314.pdf\">Public Health England, Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Coverage <\/a>"}
