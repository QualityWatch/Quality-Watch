The achievement of a urea reduction ratio (URR) of more than 65% is associated a reduced risk of complications, hospitalisation and death, and can be used to assess the adequacy of the dialysis.  The percentage of patients for which this is being achieved has been rising steadily since 2006 and was at 88% in 2011. Renal failure and dialysis also increase the risk that the patient will develop anaemia.  Best practice guidance recommends that dialysis patientsâ€™ haemoglobin levels should not fall below 10 g\/dl, and not exceed 12 g\/dl in patients with severe cardiovascular disease.  The percentage of dialysis patients in this range has been increasing steadily, and now includes nearly two thirds of patients.  However, the percentage of patients with haemoglobin < 10 g\/dl has also been rising, although it may have stabilised in the latest two years for which data are available.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Renal Association, UK Renal Registry"}
