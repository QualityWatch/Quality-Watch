The achievement of a urea reduction ratio (URR) of more than 65% is associated with a reduced risk of complications, hospitalisation and death.  The percentage of patients for which this is being achieved has been rising steadily since 2006 and was at 88% in 2011. Renal failure and dialysis also increase the risk that the patient will develop anaemia.  Best practice guidance recommends that dialysis patients’ haemoglobin levels should not fall below 10 g\/dl.  The percentage of patients for which this level is achieved has been falling steadily for both HD and PD patients since 2006. The 2008 report of the UK Renal Registry suggests that the introduction of a recommended upper limit for haemoglobin (12 g\/dl) in patients with severe cardiovascular disease – and the struggle to comply with both limits – has impacted performance on this measure.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "UK Renal Registry"}
