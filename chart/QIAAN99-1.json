Since 2010, this has been decreasing. We also see that the extent of increases are greater for some staff groups and not all follow the same overall pattern. <br><br>The numbers of qualified nursing staff and those who support clinical staff increased less overall than the other groups. Nurse numbers increased just about every year until 2009, where they began to steady out in relation to the 2002 baseline figures. In contrast to this, the number of doctors has been steadily increasing every year and has increased by over 40% since 2002; compared to the 14% increase observed with nursing staff.<br><br>Ambulance staff also saw a decrease in numbers between 2005 and 2006. On 1 July 2006, significant changes were made to the way the ambulance service is organised. The number of ambulance trusts covering England was reduced from 31 to 12 and a more integrated approach to community healthcare was adopted.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, NHS Hospital & Community Health Service Workforce Statistics"}
