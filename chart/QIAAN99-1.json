Scientific, therapeutic, and technical staff have seen the greatest increase in numbers (a 50% increase), followed by doctors (a 29% increase). The number qualified nursing staff hasn't increased at the same rate as doctors and has increased by 28,173 FTEs, representing a 9% increase. <br><br>Ambulance staff saw a decrease in numbers between 2005 and 2006, which can be associated with changes in the way the ambulance service was organised, but has increased overall by 7%. <br><br>The only group that hasn't seen an increase in the number of FTEs is Qualified Healthcare Scientists. The numbers of staff in this group was increasing between 2004 and 2009, but this has declined since then to 2014 resulting in a decrease of 3% of FTEs overall in this staff group compared to 2004.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/searchcatalogue?productid=18409&topics=0%2fWorkforce&sort=Relevance&size=100&page=1#top\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, NHS Hospital & Community Health Service Workforce Statistics<\/a>"}
