Life expectancy at 65 has also increased for both genders over the last 30 years, since 1980 this was by 4.3 years for females and 6 years for males.<br><br>Females still have a higher life expectancy at age 65 than males. In 2013 women at age 65 lived on average 2.3 years longer than men. This is a much smaller difference than the almost 4 years in the life expectancy at birth rates. <br><br>Again, life expectancy at age 65 for women has slightly decreased since 2011 - from 21.1 years to 20.9 years in 2013.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Statistics 2015"}
