Females still have a higher life expectancy than males – this was a difference of 2.4 years in 2012 – which is much less than the difference of four years for the life expectancy at birth rates. Life expectancy at 65 has also increased over the last 30 years, this was by 3.9 years for females and 5.5 years for males.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Statistics 2014"}
