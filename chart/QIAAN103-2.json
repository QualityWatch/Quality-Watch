"analysis_commentary" : "<P>The percentage of people waiting more than four hours for their treatment to be completed in A&amp;E fell dramatically before and after the introduction of the target in January 2004, although it was over a year until the target was finally achieved. It is also notable that the target was not achieved consistently, with winter months often breaching but still under 4%. The relaxation of the target to 5% in 2010 was associated with an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, but performance was in line with the new target.  Performance was maintained at the 95% level until September 2012, when it began to drop.  By April 2013, achievement had fallen to just 90% - the lowest level since the introduction of the four hour target in January 2004.  Since May 2013, the proportion of people waiting in A&amp;E for four hours or less has returned to around the 95% level.</P>",
