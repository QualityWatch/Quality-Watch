Minor A&Es (types 2 & 3, such as urgent care centres or minor injury units) nearly always treat people in less than four hours, but major (type 1) A&Es deal with higher number of attendees and more serious cases, meaning they find it harder to achieve the four-hour target. Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients spend less than four hours in A&E. The percentage of people seen in A&E in less than four hours rose dramatically with the introduction of the target in January 2004, reaching the old 98% target in Q2 2005\/06. Over the next five years, performance varied between 96% and 98% and while there were large increases in the number of people using minor A&Es, increases in major A&E attendances was modest. The relaxation of the target to 95% in 2010 was associated with an increase in patients waiting more than four hours in major A&Es, but performance was initially still in line with the new target until Q2 2012\/13. By Q4 2015\/16, this had fallen to 82%, the worst level since the introduction of the four hour target. Although this is also associated with the normal seasonal fluctuations seen in winter A&E waiting times, this was much poorer than previous years. Also, performance in subsequent quarters has not returned to the previous levels seen in non-winter months.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
