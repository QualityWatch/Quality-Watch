Minor A&Es (types 2 & 3, such as single specialty departments or minor injury units) nearly always treat people in less than four hours, but major (type 1) A&Es deal with a higher number of attendees and more serious cases, meaning they find it harder to achieve the four-hour target. <br><br>The percentage of patients attending A&E that were admitted, transferred or discharged within four hours rose dramatically with the introduction of the 98% target in January 2004, and this target was met in Q2 2005\/06. Over the next five years, performance varied between 96% and 98% and while there were large increases in the number of people using minor A&Es, increases in major A&E attendances were modest. <br><br>The relaxation of the target to 95% in 2010 was associated with an increase in patients waiting more than four hours in major A&Es, but performance initially remained close to or above the new target. By Q4 2017\/18, performance had fallen dramatically to 76.8%, the worst level since the introduction of the four-hour target. Meanwhile, the total number of A&E attendances has been increasing over time, reaching over 6 million attendances in Q1 2017\/18.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ae-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions<\/a>"}
