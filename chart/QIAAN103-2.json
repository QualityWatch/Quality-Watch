Over the next five years, the proportion of breaches was between 2 and 4%. The relaxation of the target to 5% in 2010 was associated with an increase in patients waiting more than four hours, but performance was initially still in line with the new target until Quarter 2 2012\/13, when it began to increase. By Quarter 4 2012\/13, this had risen to 9% - the highest level since the introduction of the four hour target.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
