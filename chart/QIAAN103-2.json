Minor A&Es (types 2&3, such as urgent care centres or minor injury units) nearly always treat people in less than four hours, but major (type 1) A&Es deal with higher number of attendees and more serious cases, meaning they find it harder to achieve the four-hour target.  Nevertheless, the vast majority of patients spend less than four hours in A&E.  The percentage of people seen in A&E in under four hours rose dramatically with the introduction of the target in January 2004, reaching the old 98% target in Quarter 2 2005\/06. Over the next five years, performance varied between 96% and 98% and while there were large increases in the number of people using minor A&E increases in major A&E attendances was modest. The relaxation of the target to 95% in 2010 was associated with an increase in patients waiting more than four hours in major A&Es, but performance was initially still in line with the new target until Quarter 2 2012\/13, when it began to increase. By Quarter 4 2012\/13, this had fallen to 91% - the highest level since the introduction of the four hour target - and has not yet returned to the target level.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
