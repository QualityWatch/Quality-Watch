Between 2001\/02 and 2012\/13 the annual number of emergency admissions for ACS conditions increased by 48%, rising from  704,153 to 1,043,913 â€“ an increase of 339,760.  Over the same time period emergency admissions for non-ACS conditions increased by only 34%, meaning that the proportion of all emergency admissions that were ACS increased from 18% in 2001\/02 to 20% in 2012\/13.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
