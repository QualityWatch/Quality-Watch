Recognising the importance of this link, the Department of Health introduced a 6 week diagnostic wait as a target from March 2008 to ensure people would not be waiting longer than 6 weeks following referral from a GP. It was planned that this target would support achievement of the longer 18 week referral to treatment target.  <br><br>The proportion of diagnostic tests where patients wait longer than 6 weeks or 13 weeks has fallen dramatically since March 2008, when the 6-week target was introduced. Since then the proportion waiting longer than these targets has been fairly steady, and always less than 5%. In June 2010, central performance management of targets was relaxed and we can see an increase in waits over 6 weeks recorded around May 2011. This target was changed further in 2012\/13, with the expectation that fewer than 1% of patients should wait 6 weeks or longer for a diagnostic test. We see the impact of this, as from February 2012 to November 2013 the proportion stayed around 1%. However, since then, this target has not been met and in a number of months over 2% of people on the waiting list have waited more than 6 weeks for diagnostic tests. <br><br>Update November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/monthly-diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
