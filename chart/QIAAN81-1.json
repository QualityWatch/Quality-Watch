Recognising the importance of this link, the Department of Health introduced a 6 week diagnostic wait as a target from March 2008. This was to ensure people would not be waiting longer than 6 weeks for a diagnostic test following referral from a GP. It was planned that the introduction a target for diagnostic waiting times would support achievement of the longer 18 week referral to treatment target.  <br><br>The proportion of diagnostic tests where patients waiting longer than 6 weeks or 13 weeks has fallen dramatically since March 2008, when the 6-week target was introduced. Since then the proportion waiting longer than these targets has been fairly steady, always less than 5%. In June 2010, central performance management of targets was relaxed and we can see an increase in waits over 6 weeks recorded around May 2011, though this fell later in that year. More recently, since November 2013, the proportion waiting more than 6 weeks has been increasing and was 2.2% in April 2014.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times"}
