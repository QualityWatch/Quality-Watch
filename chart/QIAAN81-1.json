Recognising the importance of this link, the Department of Health introduced a 6 week diagnostic wait as a target from March 2008 to ensure people would not be waiting longer than 6 weeks following referral from a GP. It was planned that this target would support achievement of the longer 18 week referral to treatment target.  <br><br>The proportion of diagnostic tests where patients wait longer than 6 weeks or 13 weeks has fallen dramatically since March 2008, when the 6-week target was introduced. Since then the proportion waiting longer than these targets has been fairly steady, always less than 5%. In June 2010, central performance management of targets was relaxed and we can see an increase in waits over 6 weeks recorded around May 2011. This target was changed further in 2012\/13, with the expectation that less than 1% of patients wait more than 6 weeks, was introduced. We see the impact of this, as from February 2012 to November 2013 the proportion stayed around 1%. However, since then, the proportion waiting more than 6 weeks has been increasing and was 1.7% in July 2014.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times"}
