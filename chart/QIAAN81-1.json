Recognising the importance of this link, the Department of Health introduced a six week diagnostic wait as a target from March 2008 to ensure people would not be waiting longer than six weeks following referral from a GP. It was planned that this target would support achievement of the longer 18-week referral to treatment target.  <br><br>The proportion of diagnostic tests where patients wait longer than six weeks or 13 weeks fell dramatically between January and March 2008. Since then the proportion waiting longer than these targets has been fairly steady, and always less than 5%. In June 2010, central performance management of targets was relaxed and we can see an increase in waits over six weeks recorded around May 2011. This target was changed further in 2012\/13, with the expectation that fewer than 1% of patients should wait six weeks or longer for a diagnostic test. We see the impact of this, as from February 2012 to November 2013 the proportion stayed around 1%. However, since then, this target has not been met and in a number of months the figure has remained around 2% . In May 2017, 1.9% of tests took place after more than 6 weeks.<br><br>Updated July 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
