Recognising the importance of this link, the Department of Health introduced a six-week diagnostic wait 'milestone' in March 2008 to ensure that no one would wait longer than six weeks following referral for a diagnostic test. This target was initially introduced to support the achievement of the 18-week RTT target.<br><br>The proportion of patients with a diagnostic test wait time of longer than six weeks or 13 weeks fell dramatically between January 2007 and March 2008. Since then, the proportion of people waiting longer than these targets has been fairly steady, fluctuating at less than 3%. In June 2010, central performance management of targets was relaxed and this corresponds to the increase in waits over six weeks that were recorded around May 2011. The NHS Operating Framework 2012\/13 introduced a further expectation that less than 1% of patients should wait six weeks or longer for a diagnostic test. The impact of this can be seen clearly, as from February 2012 to November 2013 the proportion stayed around 1%. However, since then the 1% target has not been met. In February 2018, 1.6% of people were waiting more than six weeks for a diagnostic test.<br><br>Updated April 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
