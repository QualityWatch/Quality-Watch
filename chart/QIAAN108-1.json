Overall, this proportion has increased from 2009\/2010 when 56% responded positively compared to 64% in 2014.<br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The trend is in the right direction, but it is worth noting that there were still more than 1 in 10 patients (12%) stating that they didn't feel supported by any organisation to manage their long-term condition(s) in the last 6 months. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, GP patient survey"}
