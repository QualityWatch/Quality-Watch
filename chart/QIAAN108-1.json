There was an increase in those reporting positively from 2010\/11 to 2011\/12, where the total responding 'yes' increased by 10.4 percentage points in a year. Since then, these trends have been quite stable, but did decrease one percentage point to 64% in 2014\/15. In 2015\/16, 38.5% felt that 'yes, definitely' they had enough support and 24.6% felt that 'yes, to some extent' they had enough support. <br><br>It is worth noting that there were still more than 1 in 10 patients (12.4% in 2015\/16) stating that they didn't feel they had enough support to manage their long-term condition(s) in the last 6 months. <br><br>Updated September 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/gp-patient.co.uk\/surveys-and-reports\"> NHS England, GP patient survey<\/a>"}
