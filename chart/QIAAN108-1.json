There was an increase in those reporting positively from 2010\/11 to 2011\/12; where the total responding 'yes' increased by 10.4% in a year. Since then these trends have been stable and in July 2015, 38.6% felt they 'yes, definitely' had enough support and 24.7% felt 'yes, to some extent' had enough support. <br><br>The trend is in the right direction, but it is worth noting that there were still more than 1 in 10 patients (12.4% in July 2015) stating that they didn't feel the had enough support to manage their long-term condition(s) in the last 6 months. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, GP patient survey"}
