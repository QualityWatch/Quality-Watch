In 2006\/07, 15.8% of pregnant women were smokers and this decreased to 10.7% in 2016\/17. Despite this 5% decrease in prevalence, the reduction in smoking rates among pregnant women has slowed in the past year with a percentage decrease of only 0.3%; this prompted concern from <a href=\"http:\/\/smokefreeaction.org.uk\/smokefree-nhs\/smoking-in-pregnancy-challenge-group\/\">health charities<\/a>. The previous target to reduce the percentage of women who smoke during pregnancy to 11% or less was met in 2015\/16, and in July 2017 a new target was set to reduce the prevalence to 6% or less by 2022.
