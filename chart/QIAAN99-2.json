In general, the number of staff had been decreasing from September 2009 to July 2011, and since then the numbers have stabilised. In August 2012 it reached its lowest point in the time period where there were 304,566 nurses compared to 307,749 in September 2009, a decrease of 3,183. <br><br>There is also an annual fluctuation where there is a peak in November of each year, starting with an increase in September, when newly graduating staff join the workforce. Although there are also subsequent decreases, as other nurses leave the workforce, which usually results in numbers lower than at the start of the peak.<br><br>The pre-2013 annual peak increase (November 2013 data is yet to be published) appears to have replenished nurse numbers so that they are close to the maximum number of nurses observed March 2010; further information that provide nursing levels after this date is required to observe to what extent this is sustained over time.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, NHS Hospital & Community Health Service Workforce Statistics"}
