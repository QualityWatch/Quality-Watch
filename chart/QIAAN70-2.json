These are: <br>- that at least 15% of adults who need a psychological therapy can access it, and<br>- that there is at least a 50% recovery rate for those who complete treatment through the IAPT programme. <br><br>For the first objective it is estimated that there are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.iapt.nhs.uk\/silo\/files\/iapt-3-year-report.pdf\">6 million people in England<\/a> who have a common mental health disorder. It was agreed that the IAPT programme could provide genuine benefit by treating 15% or 900,000 of these patients every year. This figure was agreed because some people would not seek treatment or would not be suitable for psychological therapy. <br><br>Since 2011-12, the proportion of IAPT referrals receiving treatment has increased every year. However, although we don't yet have full year data for 2014-15, it looks unlikely to meet the goal of 15% this year. Based on performance from Q1 to Q3 2014-15 only, this is 12.7%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/iapt\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Data Set<\/a>"}
