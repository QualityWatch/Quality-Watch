The CPA is used to coordinate care for people who have more severe or complex mental health needs. Because their needs are generally more severe and\/or complex it is likely the experience and services they get will differ from people not on CPA (Department of Health, 2008).<br><http:\/\/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/20130107105354\/http:\/www.dh.gov.uk\/prod_consum_dh\/groups\/dh_digitalassets\/@dh\/@en\/documents\/digitalasset\/dh_083649.pdf><br><br>Here, we can see that people on CPA are more likely to have at least one meeting to review their care in a year. In 2013, 75% of people on CPA had at least one care review meeting, compared to 53% not on CPA. However, people on CPA should have regular reviews and a quarter of people in 2013 didn't have one. This hasn't really improved from previous years.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Community Mental Health Survey"}
