The CPA is used to coordinate care for people who have more severe or complex mental health needs. Because their needs are generally more severe and\/or complex it is likely the experience and services they get will differ from people not on CPA (Department of Health, 2008).<br>http:\/\/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/20130107105354\/http:\/www.dh.gov.uk\/prod_consum_dh\/groups\/dh_digitalassets\/@dh\/@en\/documents\/digitalasset\/dh_083649.pdf<br><br>Here, we can see that people on a CPA are more likely to have at least one meeting to review their care in a year. In 2014, 83% of people on a CPA had a meeting to review their care, compared to 69% of people not on a CPA. The number of people having a meeting to review their care has increased markedly in the past year, from 75% to 83% for patients on a CPA, and from 53% to 69% for patients not on a CPA, both of these increases are significant.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Community Mental Health Survey"}
