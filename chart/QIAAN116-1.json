The CPA is used to coordinate care for people who have more severe or complex mental health needs. Because their needs are generally more severe and\/or complex it is likely the experience and services they get will differ from people not on CPA<br><a href=\"http:\/\/webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk\/20130107105354\/http:\/www.dh.gov.uk\/prod_consum_dh\/groups\/dh_digitalassets\/@dh\/@en\/documents\/digitalasset\/dh_083649.pdf\">Department of Health<\/a>.<br><br>People on a CPA are more likely to have at least one formal meeting to discuss their care in a year. In 2015, 82% of people on a CPA had a meeting to review their care, compared to 67% of people not on a CPA. Since 2014, service users were asked if they had a formal meeting with someone from NHS mental health services to discuss how their care is working in the past 12 months. Prior to that, people had been asked if they had had a care review meeting to discuss their care and fewer reported they had one.   <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cqc.org.uk\/content\/community-mental-health-survey-2015\">Care Quality Commission, Community Mental Health Survey<\/a>"}
