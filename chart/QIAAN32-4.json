Some countries collect survey data and some have screening programmes, symbols in the chart denote data collection: ^ - Survey data * - Programme data.<br><br>When compared to other countries, UK had one of the highest cervical cancer screening rates between 2000 and 2009. However, the proportion of women screened has been steadily declining during this period. The sudden drop in 2010 is due to a change in the method of calculation; however, coverage appears to be further declining in 2011. While this data captures UK rather than only England, the declining trend is consistent with the negative trend in England highlighted above. It should be noted that there may be important differences in how the data are calculated. Nevertheless, this negative trend should be closely monitored, especially given the importance of screening for early detection, provision of effective treatment and survival. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
