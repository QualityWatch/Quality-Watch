The proportion of joiners is highest in Thames Valley (13.6%). The proportion of leavers is also highest in Thames Valley (10%) and in Special Health Authorities (14.5%).  Special Health Authorities provide a health service to the whole of England, not just to a local community (e.g. National Blood and Transplant Authority, NHS Business Services Authority and NHS Litigation Authority. The largest difference between the proportion leaving and joining can be observed in South London with a leaving rate of 9.6% and a joining rate of 13.2% (a difference of 3.6%).<br><br>Updated January 2017.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : " <a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/article\/2021\/Website-Search?productid=24139&q=NHS+Workforce+Statistics&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1&area=both#top\">NHS Digital, NHS Workforce Statistics<\/a>"}
