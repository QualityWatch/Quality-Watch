OECD data show that rates of both procedures have been increasing in most countries since 2000, with generally a faster increase for knee replacements. Germany carries out the most hip and knee replacements with rates per head of population approximately 76% and 38% respectively higher than those seen in the UK - even though the increase seems to have levelled off since 2008\/9. UK's rate of hip replacements is very similar to rates in Australia and Italy. For knee replacements, UK has rates similar to Sweden's and Italy's. Differences in population structure and age-standardisation only explain some of the cross-country variation (OECD, 2013).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "OECD, Health Statistics 2013"}
