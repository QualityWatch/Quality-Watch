This is especially for patients who have severe pain or their mobility is affected. The two graphs show that rates of both procedures have been increasing in most countries since 2000, with generally a faster increase for knee replacements. Germany carries out the most hip and knee replacements even though the increase seems to have levelled off since 2008\/9. The UK's rate of hip replacements is very similar to rates in Australia and Italy. For knee replacements, the UK has rates similar to Sweden's and Italy's. Differences in population structure and age-standardisation only explain some of the cross-country variation (OECD, 2013).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "OECD, Health Statistics 2013"}
