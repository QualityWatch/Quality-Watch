The East Midlands had the lowest proportion of carers who always or usually felt involved or consulted in 2014-15, at 46.5%. This is 17.2 percentage points below the highest level, seen in the North East, and 7.8 percentage points below the national average of 54.3%. The responses included those who said that no discussions had happened in the previous 12 months. <br>The data from 2009-10 was not aggregated in regional groups, so they are not included here. More than half of regions reported lower proportions of carers feeling involved in discussions in 2014-15 than 2012-13.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/catalogue\/PUB18423\">NHS Digital, Personal Social Services Survey of Adult Carers in England<\/a>"}
