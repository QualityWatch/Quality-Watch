Ischaemic heart disease represents 15.9 per cent of years of life lost and 6.8 per cent is due to cerebrovascular diseases (of which 3 per cent is due to haemorrhagic and other non-ischaemic stroke and 3.8 per cent is due to ischaemic stroke) (Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, 2013). The majority of strokes in England are ischaemic – that is, where a clot blocks blood flow to part of the brain; haemorrhagic strokes happen when a blood vessel bursts and bleeds into the brain. <br><br>Mortality rates, which are used as a proxy for the quality of acute care, have been stable or declining over time in most of the countries. For ischaemic stroke, patient-based 30-day in-hospital and out-of-hospital mortality rates have been declining rapidly in the UK (they fell from 17 per 100 patients in 2008 to 12.4 per 100 patients in 2011) but still remain above almost all the other comparator countries (New Zealand’s rate was 13.1 per 100 patients in 2011). Sweden has the lowest rate of the comparator countries and Korea the lowest of all the OECD countries. Admission-based ischaemic stroke, 30-day in-hospital mortality has also been declining but the UK has the highest rate of all the comparator countries, with 10.4 deaths per 100 hospital discharges in 2011 (see Appendix 4). The US has the lowest rate of the comparator countries and Japan the lowest rate of all the OECD countries. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
