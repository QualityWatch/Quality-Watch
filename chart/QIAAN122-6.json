While there has been a continuous increase in the UK over time, in 2007-2012 five-year relative survival reached only 54.5%. In the same year in Sweden it was as high as 63.9% and in Australia it reached 66.2% in 2005-2010.<br><br>Overall,  as survival rates capture both how good the system is in detecting the disease and whether people have rapid access to effective treatment, it is essential to better understand what could be done to further improve survival rates and close the gap with other OECD countries. <br><br>Given that cervical and breast cancer screening coverage is already relatively high in the UK, it would be important to further examine any potential delays in diagnosis (after screening or first presentation with symptoms) and access to effective treatment. However, there is still plenty of scope to improve colorectal cancer screening coverage (<a href=\"http:\/\/ije.oxfordjournals.org\/content\/40\/3\/712.short\"> von Wagner et al, 2011 <\/a>). In addition, changes to the screening programme (e.g. a new bowel scope screening programme) may also increase the proportion of cancers detected by screening.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
