This a difference of 5.6 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively. <br><br>Evidence suggests that there is a 'London effect' experienced in healthcare where people in London are in general less satisfied with their care compared to the rest of England. Research suggests this could be due to a younger, more transient and more ethnically diverse population in London[1-3]. This effect could be used to explain the similar results we see here in social care service satisfaction. <br>[1] <a href='http:\/\/www.kingsfund.org.uk\/sites\/files\/kf\/field\/field_publication_file\/general-practice-in-london-dec12.pdf'  target='_blank'> General practice in London Supporting improvements in quality <\/a> (King's Fund) <br>[2] <a href='http:\/\/www.ipsos-mori.com\/Assets\/Docs\/Archive\/Polls\/healthcarecommission.pdf'  target='_blank'> Understanding Public and Patient Attitudes to the NHS  <\/a>  (Healthcare Commission)<br>[3] <a href='http:\/\/www.kingsfund.org.uk\/time-to-think-differently\/audio-video\/anne-rainsberry-what-does-health-care-currently-look-london'  target='_blank'> Anne Rainsberry: what does health care currently look like in London?  <\/a>  (King's Fund)<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Adult Social Care Survey"}
