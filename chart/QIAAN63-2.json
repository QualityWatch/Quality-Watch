 "analysis_commentary" : "<P>Looking at satisfaction by region, we can see that London performs worse overall, with 57.2% of those in London being satisfied compared with the national average of 62.8% in 2011\/12, and 58.2% in London compared to the national average of 63.7% in 2012\/13. This a difference of 5.6 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively. Evidence suggests that there is a 'London effect' experienced in healthcare where people in London are in general less satisfied with their care compared to the rest of England. Research suggests this could be due to a younger, more transient and more ethnically diverse population in London[1-3]. This effect could be used to explain the similar results we see here in social care service satisfaction. <br> <br> [1] <a href='http:\/\/www.kingsfund.org.uk\/sites\/files\/kf\/field\/field_publication_file\/general-practice-in-london-dec12.pdf'> General practice in London Supporting improvements in quality <\/a> (King's Fund) <br>  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Personal Adult Social Care Survey"}
