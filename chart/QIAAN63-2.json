This a difference of 5.6 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively. Evidence suggests that there is a 'London effect' experienced in healthcare where people in London are in general less satisfied with their care compared to the rest of England. Research suggests this could be due to a younger, more transient and more ethnically diverse population in London[1-3]. This effect could be used to explain the similar results we see here in social care service satisfaction.
