The term 'CPA' describes a framework introduced in 1990 to support and coordinate effective mental health care for people with mental health problems in secondary mental health services. As part of the CPA, people should have regular care meetings. Here we look at what proportion of adults in these meetings is employed. Although data before 2011\/12 Q1 isn't final, we can see that since a high of 8.9% in 2010\/11 Q4, this proportion has generally been decreasing. Since 2012\/13 Q4, where data has become monthly, this proportion has remained around 7.0%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "The Health & Social Care Information Centre, Mental Health Minimum Dataset"}
