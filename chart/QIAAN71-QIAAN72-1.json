They are caused when an area of skin is placed under pressure. Pressure ulcers tend to affect people with conditions that make it difficult to move, especially those confined to lying in a bed or sitting for prolonged periods of time. Conditions that affect the flow of blood through the body, such as type 2 diabetes, can also make a person more vulnerable to pressure ulcers.<br><br>Pressure ulcers have been used as a marker of good basic nursing care for some time. The severity of ulcers is recorded using a scale from 1 to 5 â€“ where 5 are the most serious. <br><br>In acute settings, incidence of type 2, 3 and 4 pressure ulcers decreased from 5.6% of sampled patients in April 2012 to a low of 3.8% in September 2015, but this has fluctuated since. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href= \"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=NHS+Safety+Thermometer&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1#top\"> NHS Digital, NHS Safety Thermometer<\/a>"}
