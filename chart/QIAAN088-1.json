This standard has not been reached in the last few months of 2013.<br><br>Between April 2011 and December 2013 there were ten months where this standard was breached nationally, which translates into a breach one month out of three. The frequency of breaches is also increasing year on year. In 2011\/12 there were only two breaches, in 2012\/13 there were three breaches and so far in 2013\/14 this has increased to five breaches. In 2011\/12 and 2012\/13, the breaches mainly occurred during the December to March period, however, in 2013\/14 the breaches first occurred during July 2013 (74%), after which it slightly recovered in August 2013 (75%) , before being breached again in September 2013 and continuing to decrease to 72% in December 2013.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
