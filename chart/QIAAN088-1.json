In January 2013 73.5% of Red 1 calls were attended within 8 minutes. This declined to 66.7% by January 2017. There was a similar decline amongst Red 2 calls over the same period, falling from 75.8% in 2013 to 58.5% in 2017. In particular, there was a substantial decrease in performance from March 2014 to December 2014, although some of the change around this period was driven by London Ambulance Service (see the below chart 'How has the proportion of category A (red 1 and 2) calls attended within 8 minutes varied by commissioning region?'). Subsequent to this, there was some improvement, but this number fell again from May 2015.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
