This report highlighted issues with housing and that 'many people with learning disabilities – unlike the rest of the population – do not choose where they live or with whom; and more than half live with their families, and most of the remainder live in residential care'. <br><br>Here, we look at the proportion of adults with learning disabilities who live in their own home or with their families. Due to a change in who is included in this measure, data from 2010-11 is not directly comparable to data from 2011-12; for more information please see 'about this data' below. Despite this, the proportion has increased over the years we have data for and was at a high of 74% in 2012-13. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Adult Social Care - Combined Activity Return (ASC-CAR)"}
