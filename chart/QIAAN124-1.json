This report highlighted issues with housing and that 'many people with learning disabilities – unlike the rest of the population – do not choose where they live or with whom; and more than half live with their families, and most of the remainder live in residential care'. <br><br>Here, we look at the proportion of adults with learning disabilities who live in their own home or with their families. Due to a change in who is included in this measure, data from 2010-11 is not directly comparable to data from 2011-12; for more information please see 'about this data' below. The proportion of people with a learning disability living at home increased to a peak of 74.9% in 2013-14, but fell to 73.3% in 2014-15.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Adult Social Care Outcomes Framework<\/a>"}
