"analysis_commentary" : "<P>In England, the percentage of children who have completed a primary course of immunisation for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis and  haemophilus influenzae b (Hib) has increased over the last ten years from a baseline of around 90-91% (depending on the vaccination) to 95% in 2011/12. After the introduction of a combined vaccination for immunisation against all five diseases, this increase seems to be greater. This suggests that the availability of a single, combined vaccination could have contributed to the increase, as it makes it easier for parents and children to take the immunisations. However, a similar pattern over the ten years  is also seen in meningococcal group C immunisation, which may suggest an overall increase in vaccination coverage across the board, irrespective of the new delivery method. This is also reflected in the pneumococcal disease (PCV) vaccination in the last four years of the data, where it follows a similar pattern to the other two vaccinations after a large increase in the percentage of children taking the vaccination in 2008/09 compared to 2007/08.</P>",
