There was a slight decline in uptake between the years of 1995\/96 and 2005\/06 but after the introduction of a combined vaccination for immunisation against all five diseases in 2006\/07 this trend reversed. The availability of a single, combined vaccination could make it easier for parents and children to take the immunisations. However, a similar pattern is also seen in meningococcal group C immunisation (MenC) over the time period where MenC information is collected, which may suggest an overall increase in vaccination coverage across the board, irrespective of the new delivery method. This is also reflected in the pneumococcal disease (PCV) vaccination in the last four years of the data, where it follows a similar pattern to the other two vaccinations after a large increase in the percentage of children taking the vaccination in 2008\/09 compared to 2007\/08.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Public Health England, Cover of vaccination evaluated rapidly programme <https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/collections\/vaccine-uptake>"}
