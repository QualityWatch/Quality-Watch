After the introduction of a combined vaccination for immunisation against all five diseases in 2004\/05, this increase seems to be greater. This suggests that the availability of a single, combined vaccination could have contributed to the increase, as it makes it easier for parents and children to take the immunisations. However, a similar pattern over the ten years is also seen in meningococcal group C immunisation, which may suggest an overall increase in vaccination coverage across the board, irrespective of the new delivery method. This pneumococcal disease (PCV) vaccination follows a similar pattern to the other two vaccinations over the past few years.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England & Public Health England & Health & Social Care Information Centre"}
