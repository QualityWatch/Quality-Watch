From 2006\/07 onwards data for diphtheria, tetanus, polio, pertussis and hib immunisation was merged into one indicator as a combined immunisation against all five diseases was introduced. <br><br>There was a slight decline in uptake between the years of 1995\/96 and 2005\/06 but after the introduction of the combined vaccination in 2006\/07 this trend reversed. The availability of a single, combined vaccination may make it easier for parents and children to take the vaccinations. However, a similar pattern is also seen in meningococcal group C immunisation (MenC) over the time period where MenC information is collected, which may suggest an overall increase in vaccination coverage across the board, irrespective of the new delivery method. This is also reflected in the pneumococcal disease (PCV) vaccination uptake, where it follows a similar pattern to the other two vaccinations after a large increase in the percentage of children taking the vaccination between 2007\/08 and 2008\/09.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/collections\/vaccine-uptake\">Public Health England, Vaccine uptake <\/a>"}
