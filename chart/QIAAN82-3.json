A marker of how successful these different methods are is to look at how many of these people re-contact 999 within the next 24 hours. Although there will of course be instances where a situation has escalated, this suggests that some people didn't get enough or the right support from their first call. <br><br>In 2011, there was a sizeable difference between the re-contact rates for those who called 999 but didn't go to hospital: those who received telephone advice only, have higher re-contact rates than those who were treated and discharged on the scene. However, this gap has decreased over time. In April 2011, 15.0% of calls re-contacted 999 within 24 hours, this had decreased to 6.3% by Septmber 2016. This decline is a positive result and suggests that the ambulance service has been improving its ability to care outside hopsital. This has improved despite the proportion of people who receive telephone advice increasing.<br><br>Re-contact for people who were treated and discharged on scene is much lower and despite some variation, has been around 5% to 6% for most time points. <br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators<\/a>"}
