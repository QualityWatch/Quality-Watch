A marker of how successful these different methods are is to look at how many of these people re-contact 999 within the next 24 hours. Although there will of course be instances where a situation has escalated, this suggests that some people didn't get enough or the right support from their first call. <br><br>In 2011, there was a sizeable difference between the re-contact rates for those who called 999 but didn't go to hospital: those who received telephone advice only, have higher re-contact rates than those who were treated and discharged on the scene. However, this gap has decreased over time. In April 2011, 15.0% of calls re-contacted 999 within 24 hours; this had decreased to 6.1% by January 2017. This decline is positive and suggests that the ambulance service has been improving its ability to care outside hospital. This has improved despite the proportion of people who receive telephone advice increasing.<br><br>Re-contact for people who were treated and discharged on scene is much lower and despite some variation, has been around 5% to 6% for most months within the time period.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators<\/a>"}
