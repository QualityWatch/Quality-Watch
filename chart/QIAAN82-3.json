A marker of how successful these different methods are is to look at how many of these people re-contact 999 within the next 24 hours. Although there will of course be instances where a situation has escalated, this suggests that some people didn't get enough or the right support from their first call. <br><br>There are real differences between the trends in re-contact rate for those who called 999 but didn't go to hospital. Those who received telephone advice only, in general, have much high re-contact rates. However, this trend has declined over time. In April 2011, 15.0% of calls re-contacted 999 within 24 hours, this had decreased to 8.3% by December 2014. This decline is a positive result and suggests that the ambulance service has been improving its ability to care outside hopsital. This has improved despite the proportion of people who receive telephone advice only increasing.<br><br>Re-contact for people who were treated and discharged on scene is much lower and despite some variation, has been about 6.0% for most time points. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
