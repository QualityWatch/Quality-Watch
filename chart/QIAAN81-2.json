Between January 2007 and January 2008 the median waiting time fell from 4.7 weeks to 2.0 weeks, in anticipation of the introduction of the national target in March 2008. The lowest median wait of 1.5 weeks occurred in January 2009. Since then, the median wait has been increasing slowly overall and has fluctuated around two weeks. In general, the median wait peaks in December every year and since 2013 it has increased to a maximum of 2.5 weeks - this is due to people not being able to schedule or attend appointments over the Christmas holidays.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
