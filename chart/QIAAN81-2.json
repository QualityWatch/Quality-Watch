In 2006, the median waiting time fluctuated around five weeks for diagnostic tests, but fell to around two weeks in January 2008, just before the national target was introduced in March 2008. The lowest median wait of around 1.5 weeks, was seen in January 2009. Since then, the median wait has been increasing, to a maximum 2.5 weeks in December 2015. We see an expected peak in December every year- this is due to people not being able to schedule or attend appointments over the Christmas holidays. <br><br>Update November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/monthly-diagnostics-waiting-times-and-activity\/\">NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times<\/a>"}
