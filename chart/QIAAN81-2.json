The median waiting time for diagnostic tests initially decreased from over 5 weeks in 2001 to around 2 weeks when the national target was introduced in March 2008. The lowest waits, around 1.5 weeks, were seen in January 2009 and since then the median wait has been increasing, to 2.0 weeks in July 2014. We see an expected peak in December every year, this is due to people not being able to schedule or attend appointments over the Christmas holidays. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Diagnostic waiting times"}
