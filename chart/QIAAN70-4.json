When reassessed at the end of treatment, people who no longer score as highly for anxiety and depression (so are no longer a clinical case or at 'caseness'), are considered recovered. The recovery rate is the proportion of people who start treatment with a high score, complete treatment having reduced their score below the clinical threshold. The recovery rate has increased slightly over time from 42.5% in 2011-12 Q1 to 45.0% in 2014-15 Q2. The objective recovery rate for IAPT to be achieved by March 2015 is 50%; this has not yet been met. <br><br>Beyond clinical recovery rates, the IAPT programme also supported 75,229 people in total to move off sickness benefits between 2011-12 Q1 and 2014-15 Q2 (data not shown), this number increased in each quarter and was 6,639 in 2014-15 Q2.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Improving Access to Psychological Therapies Data Set"}
