This level of satisfaction varies across staff in different settings: prior to 2011, acute staff had the lowest satisfaction with their work and ambulance trust staff had the highest. The following year there was a reversal and ambulance trusts have had the lowest level of satisfaction with the quality of their work since 2012. In 2014, ambulance trust staff were 4 percentage points lower than the national average. <br><br>In 2015, the responses were calculated as a scale, rather than a percentage, to better capture the nuance of respondentsâ€™ answers. This scale, which ranges from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree), varies less across staff settings and was 3.9 nationally in 2015. Staff in ambulance and mental health & learning disability trusts gave a score of 3.8, compared to 4 in acute trust settings.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
