This is demonstrated by comparing the rates of admission for falls in people aged 65 to 79 with those for people aged 80 and over. In 2012\/13, these were 920 per 100,000 and 4,944 per 100,000, respectively - five times greater. It can also be seen that the rate of admission increased more sharply for people aged 80 and over between April 2006 and December 2013 compared to people aged between 65 and 79. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
