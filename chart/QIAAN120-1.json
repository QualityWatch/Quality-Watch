From Q1 2011\/12 there was a notable increase in the employment rate among people with a mental illness. There was also an increase in employment in the general population, but the rate of increase was not as fast, thus reducing the disparity between the two. <br><br>In Q4 2006\/07 there was a 44.8 percentage point difference in employment rates between people with and without a mental illness and this had fallen to 34.2 percentage points by Q4 2015\/16. This is a big improvement, but still a huge employment gap. <br><br>Updated September 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/\">NHS Digital, NHS Outcomes Framework<\/a>"}
