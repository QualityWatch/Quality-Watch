Between these ages, the difference ranges from 11.3% to 14.9%.  However, the gap in employment rates for younger people has widened since 2007 (when the gap for 16-19 year olds was just 4.4%) whereas it has narrowed for all groups aged over 20 - most notably for those 45-49, which was 16.9% in 2007 and 14.9% in 2013.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Outcomes Framework"}
