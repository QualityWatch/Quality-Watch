However, there is an increasingly large difference in employment rates between people with and without LTCs in the younger and older age groups. Between Q4 2006\/07 and Q4 2015\/16, the employment gap in the 20-24 years age group increased the most (by 2.6 percentage points) from 3.7 to 5.9 percentage points.  <br><br>In people aged 25-54, the difference ranges from 13.2% to 14.7% across five-year age bands. The gap in employment between those with and without a LTC has narrowed for all groups across these age bands - most notably for those 45-49, which was 16.9% in 2007 and 13.8% in 2015\/16 Q4.<br><br>Updated August 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/\">NHS Outcomes Framework, NHS Digital<\/a>"}
