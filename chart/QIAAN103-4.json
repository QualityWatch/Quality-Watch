Overall, the average has remained fairly stable, around 130 minutes, but increased notably in the second half of 2014 reaching a high of 145 minutes in Dec 2014. Admitted patients spend an average of 111 minutes longer in A&E than non-admitted patients. The median time spent by non-admitted patients has stayed consistently around the 110 minutes, although this has increased recently. The median time spent by admitted patients has been more variable. The maximum of 235 minutes was seen in Dec 2014, which is an increase of 22 minutes from May 2011. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=title%3a%22Accident+and+Emergency+Quality+Indicator%22&sort=Most+recent&size=10&page=1#top\">Health & Social Care Information Centre, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
