Overall, the median waiting time remained at around 130 minutes until the second half of 2014 when it began to increase. Since 2016 the median wait for all patients has fluctuated at around 150 minutes, peaking in March 2016 at 157 minutes. <br><br>In September 2017 admitted patients spent on average 234 minutes waiting in A&E. This was almost twice as long as the median waiting time for non-admitted patients, which reached 125 minutes in the same month.<br><br>Updated November 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/digital.nhs.uk\/search?q=accident+and+emergency+quality+indicators&s=s\">NHS Digital, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
