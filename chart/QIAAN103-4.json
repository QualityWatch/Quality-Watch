Overall, the median waiting time remained at around 130 minutes until the second half of 2014 but began increasing after that. Median wait peaked in February 2016 at 156 minutes. <br><br>Admitted patients spend an average of 111 minutes longer in A&E than non-admitted patients. The median time spent by non-admitted patients had stayed consistently around 110 minutes until August 2015, but has surpassed 120 minutes since October 2015. The median time spent by admitted patients has been more variable, with a maximum median wait of 238 minutes seen in February 2016. <br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=Accident+and+Emergency+Clinical+Quality+Indicators&area=&size=10&sort=Relevance#top\">NHS Digital, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
