Overall, the average has remained fairly stable, around 130 minutes, with a high of 137 minutes in March 2013. Admitted patients spend an average of 110 minutes longer in A&E than non-admitted patients. The median time spent by non-admitted patients has stayed consistently around the 110 minutes. However, the median time spent by admitted patients had been increasing to a high of 229 minutes in March 2013 - an increase of 16 minutes since May 2011. However, since then, it has fallen to the average of 219 minutes.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, A&E Waiting Times and Activity"}
