Overall, the median waiting time remained at around 130 minutes until the second half of 2014 but began increasing after that. Median wait for all patients peaked in March 2016 at 157 minutes. <br><br>In January 2017 admitted patients spent an average of 112 minutes longer in A&E than non-admitted patients. The median time spent by non-admitted patients had stayed consistently around 110 minutes until August 2015. The median time spent by admitted patients has been more variable, with a maximum median wait of 239 minutes seen in January 2017. <br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=Accident+and+Emergency+Clinical+Quality+Indicators&area=&size=10&sort=Relevance#top\">NHS Digital, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
