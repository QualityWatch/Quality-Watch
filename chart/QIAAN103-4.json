Overall, the median waiting time remained at around 130 minutes until the second half of 2014 but began increasing after that. Median wait for all patients peaked in March 2016 at 157 minutes. <br><br>In February 2017 admitted patients spent an average of 237 minutes A&E. The median time spent by non-admitted patients had stayed consistently around 110 minutes until August 2015, but had risen to 125 minutes by February 2017. <br><br>Updated July 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/article\/2021\/Website-Search?productid=25097&q=Accident+and+Emergency+Clinical+Quality+Indicators&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1&area=both#top\">NHS Digital, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
