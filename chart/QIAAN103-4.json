Overall, the average has remained fairly stable, around 130 minutes, with a high of 137 minutes in March 2013. Admitted patients spend an average of 111 minutes longer in A&E than non-admitted patients. The median time spent by non-admitted patients has stayed consistently around the 110 minutes. However, the median time spent by admitted patients has been more variable. The maximum of 229 minutes was seen in March 2013 - an increase of 16 minutes from May 2011. However, since then, it has fallen to the average of 220 minutes.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Accident & Emergency Quality Indicators"}
