The proportion meeting the HbA1c target of less or equal than 58mmol\/mol has declined over time and so has the proportion of people with controlled cholesterol. The proportion of people meeting all the treatment targets (patients achieving HbA1c less than or equal to 58mmol\/mo, cholesterol less than 5mmol\/L and their relevant blood pressure target) increased from 33.7% in 2010\/11 to 35.9% in 2012\/13. Again, for Type 1 diabetes only 16.2% have met all treatment targets compared to 37.4% for Type 2 diabetes in 2012\/13. By age groups we find that the proportion of people under 40 are least likely to meet their treatment targets in 2012\/13:  14.7% for Type 1 and 24.3% for Type 2 under age 40 compared to 25.5% for Type 1 and 45.1% for Type 2 in the 80 and over. <br><br>Overall, younger people and those with Type 1 diabetes should receive more attention in the future. It would also be interesting to look at A&E visits and unplanned hospital admissions for short and long-term complications for people with diabetes. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "National Diabetes Audit, HQIP, IC, Diabetes UK"}
