The proportion who felt they had definitely been treated with dignity and respect decreased by 2% from 2010 to 2013. The proportion fell by a further 11 percentage points from 2013 to 2014, but note that the question posed in the survey was changed to refer to the organisation providing care, as opposed to the health or social care professional. In 2015, 7% felt they were not treated with dignity and respect.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.cqc.org.uk\/content\/community-mental-health-survey-2015\"> Care Quality Commission, Community Mental Health Survey<\/a>"}
