We also see consistent differences between male and female rates.  For all cause mortality male rates are 1.4 times the female rate, whereas for mortality amenable to health care it is 1.5 times the female rate. Mortality amenable to health care has fallen more swiftly and evenly than all cause mortality between 2001 and 2010, with a 36% reduction for females and a 37% reduction for males.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health and Social Care Information Centre, Compendium of Population Health Indicators"}
