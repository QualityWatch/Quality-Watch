When we separate these age groups there is a difference in the trends over time. The overall increase in coverage in 2008 is only seen in women aged 25 to 49. The proportion of women aged 50 to 64 adequately screened has actually been decreasing since 2005, most noticeably from 2009.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, breast screening programme and cervical screening programme"}
