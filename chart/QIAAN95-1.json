This is likely due to hospitals dealing with winter pressures. Overall, however, the trend shows that there has been a slight increase in the number of cancelled elective operations between Quarter 1 of 1994\/95 and Quarter 1 of 2013\/14. Figures from the latest quarter suggest that there are over 15,000 operation cancelled per quarter from a total of around nearly two million elective operations performed.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Cancelled Operations"}
