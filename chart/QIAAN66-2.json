"analysis_commentary" : "<P>Between 1991/92 and 1996/97, there was a relatively steady rate of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) immunisations in children by their second birthday in England, and was consistently over 90%. However, this began to decrease from 1997/98 to 2003/04. After this time, the uptake started to increase again, improving year-on-year until 2011/12, where it reached the same levels as 1997/98 of 91%. This pattern of vaccination rates is linked to a now discredited article that appeared in The Lancet in 1998, which linked the combined MMR vaccination to autism. In 2004, The Lancet partially retracted the paper and fully retracted it in 2010. Around the same time, there are specific increases in the coverage rate of the combined MMR vaccination. However, at the lowest coverage (2003/04), only 80% of children were vaccinated, which is well below the 92-94% required for herd immunity to measles and close to the 75-76% and 80-85% coverage needed for herd immunity for mumps and rubella, respectively. Subsequently there have been outbreaks of these diseases in England in recent years.</P>",
