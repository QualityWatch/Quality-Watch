Fewer patients in the younger age groups felt supported to manage their long-term condition(s) in both 2014\/15 and 2015\/16. This is lowest in the 18-24 and the 25-34 age groups, where only 55.2% felt supported in 2015\/16. The 65-74 and 75-84 year old age groups felt the most supported to manage their long-term condition(s) at roughly 76%. A slightly larger proportion of men (64.9%) reported feeling supported than women (63.7%) in 2015\/16 (Data not shown).<br><br>Updated September 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/indicators.hscic.gov.uk\/webview\/>\"NHS England, NHS Outcomes Framework<\/a>"}
