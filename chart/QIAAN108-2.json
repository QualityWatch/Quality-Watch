However, there is variation between different age groups in how patients feel about being supported. Fewer patients in the younger age groups feel supported to manage their long-term condition(s), especially in the 18 to 24 and the 25 to 34 age groups, where only 56% of patients in each group responded that they felt supported in 2012\/13. The 65 to 74 year old age group felt supported to manage their long-term condition(s) the most (78% in 2012\/13).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, NHS Outcomes Framework"}
