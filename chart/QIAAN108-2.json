However, there is variation between different age groups in how patients feel about being supported. Fewer patients in the younger age groups feel supported to manage their long-term condition(s) in both years. This is lowest in the 18 to 24 and the 25 to 34 age groups, where only 56.2% and 56.3% felt supported in 2013\/14 respectively. The 65 to 74 year old age group felt the most supported to manage their long-term condition(s) (76.5% in 2013\/14).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, NHS Outcomes Framework"}
