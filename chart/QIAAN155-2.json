Since the question was first asked in 2008, 90% of staff respondents felt they made a difference. Generally, there has been relatively little variation, except for staff in ambulance trusts, where consistently a lower number felt they made a difference. This could be due to ambulance staff not always being aware of the outcomes for patients they treat.<br><br>On average, 92% of staff from BAME groups felt they made a difference compared with 89% of white staff. There was no difference in reporting across age groups.  Staff with a disability (87%) were less likely to feel they made a difference than staff without (89%) (data not shown).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
