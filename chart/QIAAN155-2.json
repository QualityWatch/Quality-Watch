Since the question was first asked in 2008, 90% of staff respondents felt they made a difference. Generally, there has been little variation, except for staff in ambulance trusts, whose scores fell 5 percentage points (from 90% to 85%) between 2008 and 2014. This could be due to ambulance staff not always being aware of the outcomes for patients they treat.<br><br>The weighted scores from 2015 onwards cannot be directly compared to the unweighted scores for 2008 to 2014. In 2016, staff in both ambulance (81%) and mental health and learning disability (81%) had the lowest percentage of staff feeling that their job made a difference to patients. <br><br>Updated April 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1056\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2016\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
