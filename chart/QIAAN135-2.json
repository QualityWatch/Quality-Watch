Here, we see that the number of admissions to a psychiatric award - along with those gate kept by a CRHT team has been falling. This was 17,023 total admissions in 2013-14 Q4, it has decreased by nearly 2,000 since the highest seen in 2010-11 Q2. It is unclear from these data whether these reductions are due to changes in demand, for example, the CRHT team being able to reduce admissions and keep people at home, or supply, for example, fewer spaces on wards to admit people. More information is needed to understand the reduction in these numbers.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : ""}
