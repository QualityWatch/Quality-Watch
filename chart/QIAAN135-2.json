Here, we see that the total number of admissions to psychiatric wards - along with those gate-kept by CRHT teams - has been falling. Total admissions dropped to a low of 15,599 in Q4 2014\/15, and have since increased again to 16,734 in Q2 2017\/18, although this is almost 2,000 less than Q1 2010\/11. It is unclear from these data whether these reductions are due to the CRHT teams being able to prevent admissions and keep people at home, the number of crises decreasing, or a capacity issue with fewer spaces on wards to admit people. More information is needed to understand the reduction in these numbers.<br><br>Updated January 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/mental-health-community-teams-activity\/\">NHS England, Mental Health Community Teams Activity<\/a>"}
