Here, we see that the number of admissions to a psychiatric ward - along with those gate kept by a CRHT team has been falling. Total admissions dropped to a low of 15,599 in Q4 2014\/15, and has since increased again to 16,837 in Q1 2016\/17, although this is almost 2,000 less than Q1 2010\/11. It is unclear from these data whether these reductions are due to the CRHT team being able to reduce admissions and keep people at home, whether the number of crises have decreased or whether there is a capacity issue, with fewer spaces on wards to admit people. More information is needed to understand the reduction in these numbers.<br><br>Updated August 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/mental-health-community-teams-activity\/\">NHS England, Mental Health Community Teams Activity<\/a>"}
