In 2009 just over one fifth of staff reported that they felt pressure to attend work despite having felt unwell. This was followed by year on year increases in 2010, 2011 and 2012 when it reached a peak of 27% of staff reporting pressure to attend work despite feeling unwell. This subsequently decreased in 2013 and 2014, when 23% of staff felt pressure. In 2015, this indicator was changed to ask not only whether the staff member felt under pressure from colleagues to come to work while unwell but also whether they additionally put themselves under pressure to come to work. Once this was included, the percentage of staff feeling under pressure to go to work when unwell doubled.  Of the staff who attended work while unwell, 92% reported they had put themselves under pressure to attend, 25% felt pressure from a manager and 19% from colleagues (data not shown).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/Staff-Survey-2015\/\">Department of Health, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
