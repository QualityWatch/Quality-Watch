In 2009 just over one fifth of staff reported that they felt pressure to attend work despite feeling unwell. This was followed by year on year increases in 2010, 2011 and 2012 when it reached a peak of 27%. This subsequently decreased in 2013 and 2014. In 2015, this indicator was changed to ask not only whether the staff member felt pressure from colleagues but also whether they additionally put themselves under pressure to come to work.
