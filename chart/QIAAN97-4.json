In 2009, just over one fifth of staff reported that they felt pressure to attend work despite having felt unwell. This was followed by a small increase in the proportion in 2010, a small decrease in 2011, and then a sharp increase between 2011 and 2012, rising from 22.5% to 27.0%. So over a period where a drop in sickness absence rates nationally is observed there is also an increase in staff reporting that they feel pressure to work when unwell.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS staff"}
