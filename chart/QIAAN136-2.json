This meant that it was closing the significant gap to waiting times for physical health specialties, which was 97% in that year.  However, the proportion waiting fewer than 18 weeks for mental health specialties has since fallen to 74% in 2012\/13.  This pattern seems broadly consistent across all mental health specialties, although a notably lower proportion of patients seen in the learning disability speciality waiting fewer than 18 weeks (52% in 2012\/13).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
