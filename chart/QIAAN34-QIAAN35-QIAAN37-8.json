Staff were asked to rate on a scale of 1 to 5 how satisfied they were with the resources (e.g. materials, supplies and adequate staff numbers) and support from colleagues to do their work and meet conflicting demands.<br><br>Nationally, staff were quite satisfied (3.4 out of 5) with the resources. This was similar across staff groups, although ambulance staff scored a lower 3.1. Those aged 16-30 years had a higher satisfaction score (3.5) than the other age groups (data not shown). Staff without a disability felt more satisfied than those with a disability. <br><br><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
