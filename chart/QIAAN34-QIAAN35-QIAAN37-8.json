Scores range from 1 to 5; 5 represents staff experience high work pressures.<br><br>In 2013, staff reported a score of 3 (i.e. 'neutral response'), which varied little over a decade or between trust types. However, a third of staff (30%) feel that there are enough staff to enable them to do their jobs properly; this is highest amongst mental health\/learning disability staff (31%) and lowest amongst ambulance staff (20%) (data not shown). <br><br>The results were similar across different staff groups that we reviewed (medical\/dental, registered nurses, healthcare assistants, social care, allied health professionals, scientific & technical, general managers, wider healthcare team). One exception was health visitors who tended to report a little less favourably with a score of 3.5 on the 5 point scale (data not shown).<br><br>No difference was observed between the sexes of the staff responding, their age, whether the staff has a disability or not, or whether the staff is white or non-white (data not shown).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS Staff"}
