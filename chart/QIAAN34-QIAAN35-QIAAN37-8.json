Scores range from 1 to 5, with 5 representing that staff experience high work pressures.<br><br>In 2014 staff report work pressure as 3 on this scale (i.e. 'neutral response'), which has varied little over more than a decade. However, under a third (29%) of staff feel that there are enough staff to enable them to do their jobs; this is highest amongst mental staff from acute and  health\/learning disability trusts (30%) and lowest amongst ambulance staff (17%) (data not shown). <br><br>There is also very little variation between the responses between staff from the different trust types. However, in the last couple of years the responses from staff at ambulance trusts have increased when a similar shift is not seen in other trust types indicated that they might be beginning to feel more work pressures.<br><br>Different staff groups that we reviewed (registered nurses, healthcare assistants, health visitors, social care staff, allied health professionals, scientific and technical staff, general managers, and the wider healthcare team) report similarly to national results.<br><br>No difference is observed between the sex of the staff responding, their age, whether the staff has a disability or not, or whether the staff is white or non-white (data not shown).<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1006\/Latest-Results\/2014-Results\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
