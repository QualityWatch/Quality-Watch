Initially the extent of the increase doesn't look like it's been to the same extent as the increases seen in physicians, however, when similar time periods are compared the increases do seem comparable. All countries seem to reach a plateau in physician density around the middle of the 2000s, which is reflected in the nurse density data shown here.<br><br>The United Kingdom is the only country where there was a decrease in nurse density over the time period reviewed, with a drop from 9.8 nurses per 1,000 people in 1997 to 8.4 nurses per 1,000 people in 2012. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "OECD, Health Statistics 2013 "}
