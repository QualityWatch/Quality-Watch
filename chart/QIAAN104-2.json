The rate of emergency admissions for acute ACS conditions increased by 48%, from 486 admissions per 100,000 population in 2001\/02 to 718 in 2013\/14. The increase in the other and vaccine preventable category of admissions was even greater (142%), but from a much lower base (81 in 2001\/02 to 197 in 2013\/14). Rates of admission for chronic ACS conditions remained relatively stable over time (710 in 2001\/02, 668 in 2013\/14, a decrease of 6%). These latter changes are a positive sign of potential improvements in the management of chronic disease. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
