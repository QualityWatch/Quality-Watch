The rate of emergency admissions for acute ACS conditions increased by 49%, from 486 admissions per 100,000 population in 2001\/02 to 723 in 2012\/13. The increase in the other and vaccine preventable category of admissions was even greater (147%), but from a much lower base (81 in 2001\/02 to 201 in 2012\/13). Rates of admission for chronic ACS conditions remained relatively stable over time (710 in 2001\/02, 689 in 2012\/13, a decrease of 3%). These latter changes are a positive sign of potential improvements in the management of chronic disease. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
