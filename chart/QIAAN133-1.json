Staff turnover can be good and bad. If it is too high, it could be disruptive and costly but at the same time could save costs and improve quality if employees who perform poorly are the ones who leave.  Some variables found to be associated with staff turnover include job satisfaction, work pressure, flexible work options, appropriate training, experience of violence, abuse or bullying from patients or colleagues, a well-structured team environment, quality of line management and feeling of working in a safe environment (https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/215455\/dh_129656.pdf).<br><br>Using data from the Information Centre, here we look at turnover of NHS Hospital and Community Health Services staff groups working in England. Turnover statistics include joiners to and leavers from the NHS in England within a specific time period based on headcount. Staff movement within the NHS is not included in these turnover calculations. The graph shows trends for all NHS staff excluding primary care staff, bank, locums and trainee doctors. The monthly rates of staff leaving and joining the NHS between July 2012 and April 2014 (provisional data) have been fluctuating between 0.6% and 1.8%. Particularly interesting are the two peaks. Between March and April 2013, the leaving rate was 1.7%; however, this seems to have been matched with a joining rate of 1.6% in August 2013. Twelve months moving averages suggest that over time the leaving rate has been stable while the joining rate appears to be slightly increasing. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, National Workforce Statistics"}
