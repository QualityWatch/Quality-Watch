Overall, less than half of staff reported feeling unwell due to work-related stress.<br><br>In 2004 and 2005, nationally around 35% of staff reported that they had been ill due to work-related stress. This fell by approximately 7 percentage points to lows in 2008 and 2009. From 2010, the number of staff reporting stress began to increase again. There was a sharp increase of 8 percentage points in reports of illness between 2011 and 2012 and it remained at this level through 2013 and 2014. A small improvement was seen in 2015 as the percentage fell to 36% nationally.<br><br>Up until 2011 there were similar levels of reporting between the different trust types, although on average lower numbers of staff from acute trusts reported illness due to work-related stress than staff from ambulance and mental health & learning disability trusts. However, from 2012 the number of staff in ambulance trusts reporting illness due to work-related stress continued to grow at a higher rate and the disparity between ambulance trusts and the levels reported nationally or from other trust types was greater than it had been previously; in 2012 the difference from the nationally reported level was 6% and in 2013 this had increased to a difference of 11%, which has been sustained.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
