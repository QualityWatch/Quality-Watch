This fell by approximately 7 percentage points to a low point in 2008 and 2009. From 2010, the number of staff reporting stress began to increase again and there was a sharp increase of 8 percentage points in reports of illness between 2011 and 2012, representing a +27% change, and it remained at this level in 2013.<br><br>Up until 2011, there were similar levels of reporting between the different trust types, although on average lower numbers of staff from acute trusts report illness due to work-related stress than staff from ambulance and mental health & learning disability trusts. However, from 2012 the number of staff in ambulance trusts reporting illness due to work-related stress continued to grow at a greater rate and the disparity between ambulance trusts and the levels reported nationally or from other trust types is greater than it had been previously; in 2012 the difference from the nationally reported level was +6% and in 2013 this increased to +11%.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS Staff"}
