At the same time there has been a slight decline in the proportion of those who have HbA1c over 80mmol\/mol from 28.7% in 2011\/12 to 23.9% in 2013\/14; however this figure still suggests that almost one quarter of children and young people with diabetes have unacceptably high HbA1c. Approximately 60% of children have an HbA1c between 58 and 80 mmol\/mol. <br> <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.rcpch.ac.uk\/improving-child-health\/quality-improvement-and-clinical-audit\/national-paediatric-diabetes-audit-n-0\">Royal College of Paediatrics & Child Health, National Paediatric Diabetes Audit<\/a> "}
