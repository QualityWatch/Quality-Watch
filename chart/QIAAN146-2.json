At the same time there has been a slight decline in the proportion of those who have HbA1c over 80mmol\/mol from 26.4% in 2011\/12 to 25.8% in 2012\/13; however this figure still suggests that over one quarter of children and young people with diabetes have unacceptably high HbA1c. Approximately 60% of children have an HbA1c between 58 and 80 mmol\/mol. <br><br>Overall, the Audit report found that only 8% of the variability in the mean HbA1c and 7% in the variability of the proportion with an HbA1c >80 mmol\/mol across the paediatric diabetes units can be explained by factors such as ethnicity, social deprivation, gender, age and diabetes duration, suggesting that over 90% is likely to be explained by health service related factors (structure, resources, delivery of care).<br><br>In future analysis we would like to also include A&E visits and unplanned admissions for children and young people with diabetes. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "National Paediatric Diabetes Audit, HQIP and RCPCH"}
