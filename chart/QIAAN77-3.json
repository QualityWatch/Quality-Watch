However there has been a small increase from 2.97% in 2010\/11 to 3.33% in 2013\/14. Although not shown here there has been a rise in the total number of older people discharged (and therefore eligible for these services) since 2010\/11 and the number of people being offered a reablement\/rehabilitaion service has risen with this. In 2010\/11, roughly 36,600 people were offered a service compared to around 44,700 in 2013\/14.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Adult Social Care - Combined Activity Return (ASC-CAR)"}
