However there has been a small decrease from 3% in 2010\/11 to 2.9% in 2015\/16. Although not shown here there has been a rise in the total number of older people discharged (and therefore eligible for these services) since 2010\/11 and the number of people being offered a reablement\/rehabilitation service has fluctuated. In 2010\/11, roughly 36,600 people were offered a service compared to around 42,500 in 2015\/16.<br><br>Updated November 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href = \"http:\/\/content.digital.nhs.uk\/searchcatalogue?q=Community+Care+Statistics%2C+Social+Services+Activity%2C&area=&size=10&sort=Relevance#top\">NHS Digital, Community Care Statistics, Social Services Activity<\/a>"}
