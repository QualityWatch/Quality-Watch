The rate of decline seems to have been greater from 2007 onwards. In 1999, the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy was launched, which included a target to halve the under-18 conception rate between 1998 and 2010. Although progress in reducing the under-18 conception rate was made, we can see that the target of 23.3 per 1,000 population was missed by over ten conceptions per 1,000 population. Despite the end of this strategy in 2010, the conception rate continued to fall in 2011.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Office for National Statistics, Conception Statistics"}
