This is used as a marker of slow telephone response times. The proportion of calls being abandoned has remained consistently very low, around 1.3%. There has been a very slight increase over time and in December 2014, this was 1.9%, or 16,500 calls. There has also been a gradual increase in the number of calls over the same time period. This increased from 750,597 in December 2011 to 883,741 in December 2014 - an increase of 133,144 calls in three years. <br><br>The proportion of abandoned calls peaked at 2.3% twice in August 2012 and December 2012; it reached similar levels (2.2%) again in July 2014. Looking at the total number of calls at these times, we do see peaks in call volume in December 2012 and June 2014 which could explain the higher proportion of calls abandoned. We don't however see an increase in calls in August 2012 - this suggests that a higher proportion of abandoned calls is not necessarily linked to an increase in call volume alone.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators"}
