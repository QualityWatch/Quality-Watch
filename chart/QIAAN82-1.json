This is used as a marker of slow telephone response times. Between April 2011 and September 2017 there was an increase in the total number of calls. Between September 2011 and September 2017 they increased by 29% from 677,200 to 876,723. Whilst the proportion of those abandoned stayed relative stable over the same time period, with the largest proportion (2.3%) of calls abandoned in August and December 201, and the latest data show that approximately 1% of calls were abandoned.<br><br>Peaks in the proportion of calls abandoned happen more often when there are peaks in the number of calls, but not always suggesting that higher proportions of abandoned calls are not caused by higher call volumes alone.<br><br>Updated November 2017<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators<\/a>"}
