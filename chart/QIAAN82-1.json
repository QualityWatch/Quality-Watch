This is used as a marker of slow telephone response times. Until December 2014, there was a very slight increase in the proportion of calls being abandoned, but decreased to February 2016. There has been a gradual increase in the total number of calls over the time period. This increased from 688,923 in July 2011 to 853,493 in July 2016 - an increase of 164,570 calls in five years. <br><br>The proportion of abandoned calls peaked at 2.3% in August 2012 and December 2012; it reached similar levels (2.2%) again in July 2014. Looking at the total number of calls at these times, peaks in call volume in December 2012 and June 2014 could explain the higher proportion of calls abandoned. We don't, however, see an increase in calls in August 2012 - this suggests that a higher proportion of abandoned calls is not necessarily linked to an increase in call volume alone.  <br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators<\/a>"}
