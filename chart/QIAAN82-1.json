This is used as a marker of slow telephone response times. Until December 2014 there was a very slight increase in the proportion of calls being abandoned. However, including data from January to July 2015 has resulted in an overall trend of decrease for the proportion of calls abandoned. There has been a gradual increase in the total number of calls over the time period. This increased from 688,923 in July 2011 to 782,469 in July 2015 - an increase of 93,546 calls in four years. <br><br>The proportion of abandoned calls peaked at 2.3% in August 2012 and December 2012; it reached similar levels (2.2%) again in July 2014. Looking at the total number of calls at these times, we do see peaks in call volume in December 2012 and June 2014 which could explain the higher proportion of calls abandoned. We don't however see an increase in calls in August 2012 - this suggests that a higher proportion of abandoned calls is not necessarily linked to an increase in call volume alone.  <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators<\/a>"}
