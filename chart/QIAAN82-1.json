This is used as a marker of slow telephone response times. Between April 2011 and January 2017 there was an increase in the total number of calls whilst the proportion of those abandoned fell marginally over the same period. This increased from 688,923 in July 2011 to 853,493 in July 2016 - an increase of 164,570 calls in five years. <br><br>The proportion of abandoned calls peaked at 2.3% in August 2012 and December 2012; it reached similar levels (2.2%) again in July 2014. Looking at the total number of calls at these times, peaks in call volume in December 2012 and June 2014 could explain the higher proportion of calls abandoned. We don't, however, see an increase in calls in August 2012 - this suggests that a higher proportion of abandoned calls is not necessarily linked to an increase in call volume alone. The lowest proportion of calls abandoned was in May 2015 (0.4%). The latest data shows the proportion of calls abandoned in January 2017 was 1.3% compared to 1.2% in January 2012.<br><br>Updated March 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators<\/a>"}
