For example the public sector group including administration and defence, education and human and social work activities had the highest number of average days lost per worker when compared to the other sectors.  Moreover within that broad grouping in 2012 there were 0.88 average days lost per worker in the human health and social work activities sector compared to 0.51 in education and 0.35 in public administration and defence.  There has not been a noticeable fall in the subset covering human health and social work activities though it should be noted that the changes over time within the human health and social work activities are not significant. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hse.gov.uk\/STATISTICS\/lfs\/index.htm#stress\">Health and Saftey Executive, Labour Force Survey<\/a>"}
