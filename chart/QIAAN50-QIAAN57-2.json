This was a small increase on the 2009 result (87%) which had not changed since the first time the survey took place in 2003. This increase was offset by a decrease in the percentage of patients who reported they were treated with dignity and respect some of the time between 2009 and 2011 and there has been no change across all years in the percentage of patients who reported that they were not treated with dignity and respect.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Care Quality Commission, Survey of Adult Inpatients and Survey of Outpatients"}
