There also appears to be an annual pattern in the data where the ratios in Quarter 1 are lower than the other quarters of the same year. Quarter 1 corresponds to antenatal appointments in April to June and maternities in October to December of the same year; we explore this relationship more in the next graph.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Maternity (Vital signs)"}
