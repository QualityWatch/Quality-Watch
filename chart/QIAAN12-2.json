In acute trusts, there was an average of 40.6 incidents reported per 10,000 bed days from April 2014 to September 2015. In mental health trusts it was 31.6 per 10,000 bed days. <br><br>However, as the first chart shows there has been a decline in the rate of incidents that cause severe harm or death.
