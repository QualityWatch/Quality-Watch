The graph shows a slight increase in the proportion of maternities where breastfeeding was initiated but then the trend levels off to 74%. However, prevalence of breastfeeding, calculated as the proportion of all infants due for their 6-8 week check recorded by CCGs as totally or partially breastfeeding, has only reached a high of 47%. The difference in these two rates could be due to differences in how the data are recorded or the time difference between the two measures. The proportion breastfeeding is lower for the measure which happens later (at 6-8 weeks), factors which contribute to this reduction could be choice of the mother or a lack of support to continue with breastfeeding. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/maternity-and-breastfeeding\/\"><br>NHS England, Maternity and Breastfeeding<\/a> "}
