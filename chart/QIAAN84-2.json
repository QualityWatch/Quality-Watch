We assume that this is not solely because of the recent increases observed in the number of patients delayed.<br>• the recent increase in the number of patients being delayed begins around January 2014, without immediate change to the pattern in the number of delayed days. <br>• our previous analysis of this information up to April 2014 showed that despite there being an overall decrease from August 2010 in the number of patients being delayed there was still an overall increase in the number of delayed days, which we attributed to an increase in the average length of delays. So even before the increase in number of patients being delayed they was already an observed increase in people waiting longer.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\"> NHS England, Delayed transfer of care <\/a>"}
