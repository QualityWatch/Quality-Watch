However, overall, the number of days delayed has remained stable over time, with a total of 109,918 delayed days accrued in August 2010, compared to a total of 112,283 delayed days accrued in July 2013. This is despite the decrease seen in the number of patients being delayed. This may be due to an increase in the number of patients experiencing lengthier delays offsetting the overall decrease in the number of patients delayed.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Delayed transfer of care"}
