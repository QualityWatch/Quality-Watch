There was a total of 109,918 delayed days in August 2010, compared to a total of 112,700 delayed days in December 2013. Given that there have been fewer patients being delayed, we assume that there is an increase in the average length of delays â€“ though fewer people are waiting they are waiting longer.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "NHS England, Delayed transfer of care"}
