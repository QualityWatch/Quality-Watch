Some of this will be because of the increases in the number of patients delayed observed in the above chart. However, it is difficult to determine whether this is the sole contributory factor or if patients are also waiting longer than before.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/delayed-transfers-of-care\/\">NHS England, Delayed transfer of care<\/a>"}
