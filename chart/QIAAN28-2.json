Although the data is not shown here, numbers each quarter again reveal clear peaks at the start of each year for both measures, with a relatively higher number of people joining and quitting between January and March. Although the annual trend has generally increased, we do see a dip in the number of people joining and successfully quitting in 2012\/13. So it seems that though the success rate for those who decide to quit is improving, the actual number of people quitting has dropped slightly.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Statistics on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England"}
