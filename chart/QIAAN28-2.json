Since then, the number has plummeted, hitting roughly 450,000 in 2014\/15. Anecdotal evidence suggests that people increasingly smoke e-cigarettes in lieu of quitting.  The declining prevalence of smoking may also contribute to the decreasing number of quitters, although this trend outlasts the period of decline. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.hscic.gov.uk\/article\/2021\/Website-Search?productid=18388&q=NHS+stop+smoking&sort=Relevance&size=10&page=1&area=both#top\">Health and Social Care Information Centre, Statistics on NHS Stop Smoking Services<\/a>"}
