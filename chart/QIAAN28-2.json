These data show that the more spent per quitter, the lower the proportion of quitters. These results may be misleading as we don't know the details of the 'higher cost' group of quitters; these may be a hard to target group who are least likely to quit.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Statistics on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England"}
