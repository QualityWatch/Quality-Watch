In September 2017 one in ten emergency calls were resolved in this way. However, this has doubled from April 2011. This maybe due to changes in patient behaviour and how they access health services but it is also maybe down to changes to how emergency calls are handled. Increasingly, ambulance services are training staff to give advice on the phone, treat patients at the scene or take them to other facilities (such as a walk-in centre or primary care) to avoid unnecessary journeys to hospital (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dc.nihr.ac.uk\/themed-reviews\/Care%20at%20the%20scene%20final%20for%20web.pdf\"> National Institute for Health Research, 2016<\/a>).<br><br>Just over a third of emergency calls were visited by an ambulance and did result in transport to an consultant lead accident and emergency department.
