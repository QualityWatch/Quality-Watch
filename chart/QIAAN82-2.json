From April 2011 to November 2013, this was roughly 5.0% of calls. However, from November 2013 to June 2015 there was a steady increase in calls resolved with telephone advice only. By April 2015 this doubled to 10% of calls. <br>Roughly one third of calls to 999 were visited by an ambulance but the person did not need to go to hospital. This has increased from 33% in April 2011 to 38% in April 2016.<br><br>Updated November 2016<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/ambulance-quality-indicators\/\">NHS England, Ambulance Quality Indicators: System Indicators<\/a>"}
