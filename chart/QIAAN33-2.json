"analysis_commentary" : "<P>We have seen that screening coverage increased in 2008. However, different age groups should be screened within different time periods. When we separate these age groups, the increase in coverage is only seen in women aged 25 to 49, who should be screened every 3.5 years. For women aged 50-64, who should be screened every 5 years, coverage has actually decreased over time, with a noticeable decrease 2009 onwards.</P>",
