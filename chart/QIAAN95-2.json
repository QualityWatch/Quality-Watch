The percentage of elective admissions where the operation was cancelled at the last-minute has remained relatively steady over time and ranges from a maximum of 1.8% to a minimum of 0.7%. There is a slight seasonal variation with the proportion of cancelled elective operations marginally higher in Q4.<br><br>The proportion of cancellations where the patient was not operated on within 28 days of the cancellation, and therefore breached the standard, decreased between 2003 and 2010 but has since increased. In Q3 2010\/11 3.1% of patients were not operated on within 28 days of cancellation and this increased to 7.3% in Q3 2017\/18.<br><br>Updated March 2018.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.england.nhs.uk\/statistics\/statistical-work-areas\/cancelled-elective-operations\/\">NHS England, Cancelled Elective Operations<\/a>"}
