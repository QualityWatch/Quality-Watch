This represents an increase in the absolute number of alcohol related deaths in the UK from 4,525 in 1994 to 8,697 in 2014. <br><br>The alcohol-related death rate varies across the UK and is considerably higher in Scotland than the other four constituent countries. In men, there has been a generally increasing trend in England, Wales & Northern Ireland. Scotland saw a peak in alcohol related death rates in men in 2003 at 48 per 100,000 population. The Institute for Alcohol Studies reported that at that time Scottish Executive <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ias.org.uk\/What-we-do\/Alcohol-Alert\/Issue-1-2002.aspx#Scottish-National-Alcohol-Strategy-calls-time-on-binge-drinking\">launched plans<\/a> for action on alcohol problems, which may have contributed to the downward trajectory in alcohol-related deaths in the subsequent decade. In 2012, however, rates began to increase again, despite the release in 2009 of a framework for action: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.healthscotland.com\/uploads\/documents\/9615-Framework%20for%20Action.pdf\">Changing Scotlandâ€™s Relationship with Alcohol<\/a><\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopulationandcommunity\/healthandsocialcare\/causesofdeath\/bulletins\/alcoholrelateddeathsintheunitedkingdom\/registeredin2014\"> Office for National Statistics, Alcohol Related Deaths<\/a>"}
