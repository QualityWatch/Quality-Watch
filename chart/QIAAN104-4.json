The admission rate in the most deprived twentieth of the population (vigintile) increased from 2,362 admissions per 100,000 to 2,926, while that for the least deprived vigintile increased from 758 to 922. Rates of admission for people living in deprived areas have increased more than those living in less deprived areas (564 extra admissions per 100,000 in the most deprived vigintile, compared with 164 in the least deprived). Yet the percentage increase was similar (22% compared with 24%), and the relative difference between the most and least deprived remained almost constant over the period. <\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health & Social Care Information Centre, Hospital Episode Statistics (Copyright 2013, Re-used with the permission of the Health & Social Care Information Centre.
