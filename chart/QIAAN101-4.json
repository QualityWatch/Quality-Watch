The slope between deprivation and mortality rates is an indication of the degree of health inequality between local authority areas. In this case it seem that, unlike all age all cause mortality, the slope has reduced between 2001 and 2010. This suggests that rates of mortality amenable to healthcare have fallen more quickly in more deprived areas, and the distribution of rates has become more equitable. However, mortality rates for the more deprived areas remain substantially higher than those for more affluent areas.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Health and Social Care Information Centre, Compendium of Population Health Indicators"}
