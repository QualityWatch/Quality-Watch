The proportion of low birth weights in the UK has been stagnant since 2007 at around 7%. Of all the OECD countries, Finland and Iceland have the lowest proportion of low birth weights with 4.2% and 4.4% respectively. <br><br>There have been increases over the past twenty years in a number of countries which have been attributed to a number of factors. In Europe, there has been an increase in the number of multiple births, largely due to the increase in fertility treatments, and a general increase in older women giving birth. Both are associated with increased risks of infants born prematurely and\/or having a low birth weight. <br><br>Improvements in delivery management and care of new-borns have also increased the survival rates of low weight babies <a href=\"http:\/\/www.oecd-ilibrary.org\/social-issues-migration-health\/health-at-a-glance-2015\/infant-health-low-birth-weight_health_glance-2015-13-en\">(OECD, 2015).<\/a><br><br>There is evidence to suggest that low birth weight is associated with: mother's age, multiple births, marital status and deprivation (including household income and social class) <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2465519\/\">(Dibben et al, 2008;<\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/www.europeristat.com\/images\/Euro-peristat%20UK%20briefing.pdf\"> EURO PERISTAT, 2010).<\/a> It is likely that a change in one or more of these factors has contributed to the decreasing trend we have seen in the UK since 2003.<br><br>Updated May 2017.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : " <a href=\"http:\/\/stats.oecd.org\/index.aspx?DataSetCode=HEALTH_STAT\">OECD, Health data.<\/a>"}
