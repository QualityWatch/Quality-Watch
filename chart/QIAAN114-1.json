However, the proportion of low birth weights in the UK has been falling since 2002 and in 2010 was nearing the lowest of 6.5% seen in 1981. <br><br>There have been increases over the past twenty years in a number of countries which have been attributed to a number of factors. In Europe, there has been an increase in the number of multiple births, largely due to the increase in fertility treatments, and a general increase in older women giving birth. Both are associated with increased risks of infants born prematurely and\/or having a low birth weight. <br><br>Improvements in delivery management and care of new-borns have also increased the survival rates of low weight babies (OECD, 2012). <http:\/\/www.oecd-ilibrary.org\/docserver\/download\/8112121ec012.pdf?expires=1387451192&id=id&accname=guest&checksum=111218CF167139FEF742E78998C90AC7> <br><br>There is evidence to suggest that low birth weight is associated with: mother's age, multiple births, marital status and deprivation (including household income and social class) (Dibben, 2008; EURO PERISTAT, 2010) <http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC2465519\/> <http:\/\/www.europeristat.com\/images\/Euro-peristat%20UK%20briefing.pdf>. It is likely that a change in one or more of these factors has contributed to the decreasing trend we have seen in the UK.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
