Here, we look at those admitted to a stroke unit and how quickly people receive a brain scan. <br><br>The proportion of patients who were admitted directly to a stroke unit within four hours and received thrombolysis if needed has been steady over time, with 56.6% of patients meeting the criterion 2013\/2014 compared with 58% in 2015\/16. NICE clinical guidelines state that patients with stroke (who meet the criteria) should have a brain scan immediately on arrival to hospital and there is an associated target that this should happen for 50% of stroke patients within one hour. The target has been consistently missed, but the proportion of patients having their scan within an hour has increased from 41.9% 2013\/14 to 47.5% in 2015\/16.<br><br>Updated August 2016.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"https:\/\/www.strokeaudit.org\/results\/Clinical-audit\/National-Results.aspx\">Royal College of Physicians, Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP)<\/a>"}
