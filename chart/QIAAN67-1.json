Here, we look at those admitted to a stroke unit and how quickly people receive a brain-scan. <br><br>The proportion of patients who were admitted directly to a stroke unit within 4 hours and received thrombolysis if needed has been steady over time. With 56.5% of patients meeting this criteria in Jan-Mar 2014 compared to 56.3% in Oct-Dec 2014. NICE clinical guidelines state that patients with stroke (who meet the criteria) should have a brain scan immediately on arrival to hospital and there is an associated target that this happens for 50% of stroke patients within 1 hour. The target is missed in all data points, but the proportion of patients having their scan within 1 hour has increase slightly form 43.2% in Jan-Mar 2014 to 44.0% in Oct-Dec 2014.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Royal College of Physicians, Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme (SSNAP)"}
