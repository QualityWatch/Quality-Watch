Data are only available for all nine indicators from 2006 onwards. All indicators have generally been improving over time. The only exception to this is 'patients having a brain scan within 24 hours', which dipped to a low of 42.0% in 2006. In this year the question differed in the wording used in previous rounds of the audit when a much greater proportion of patients were regarded as applicable. The standard therefore became more stringent in 2006. The highest performing indicator in most years is 'rehabilitation goals agreed', which has the highest compliance rate of 94.0% in 2010.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Royal College of Physicians, National Stroke Audit"}
