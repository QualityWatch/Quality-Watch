Staff from either sex, with or without a disability, irrespective of their ethnic background (white vs. non-white) are just as likely to experience physical violence from patients based on what they report in the survey  (data not shown). <br><br>However, it appears that the younger a staff member is the more likely they are to experience physical violence from patients\/relatives, based on what staff reported in the survey.  This may be linked to certain staff roles (such as healthcare assistants and registered nurses) being populated by younger individuals, patients\/relatives showing less restraint from violence towards younger members of staff, or younger people being more likely to report violence when asked in the survey.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nhsstaffsurveys.com\/Page\/1010\/Home\/NHS-Staff-Survey-2015\/\">NHS England, NHS Staff Survey<\/a>"}
