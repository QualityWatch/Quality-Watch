Staff from either sex, with or without a disability, irrespective of their ethnic background (white vs. non-white) are just as likely to experience physical violence from patients based on what they report in the survey - data not shown. <br><br>However, it appears that the younger a staff member is, the more likely they are to experience physical violence from patients\/relatives based on what staff report in the survey. This may be linked to certain staff roles (such as healthcare assistants and registered nurses) being populated by younger individuals, that patients\/relatives show less restraint with violence towards staff members when dealing with younger individuals or that younger people are more likely to report violence when asked in the survey.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Department of Health, Survey of NHS Staff"}
