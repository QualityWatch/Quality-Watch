While survival has been improving in the UK, the country is still one of the worst performers relative to the other OECD countries included, with a five-year survival of only 60.9% in 2007-2012. This is despite a relatively high cervical cancer screening coverage. In comparison, survival in Sweden in the same year was 67.3% while survival in Korea reached 76.8% in 2005-2010.<\/P>","data_download_url" : {"url" : "","title" : ""},"data_source" : "Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, Health Data"}
