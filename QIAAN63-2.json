"analysis_commentary" : "<P>Looking at satisfaction by region, we can see that London performs worse overall, with 57.2% of those in London being satisfied compared with the national average of 62.8% in 2011\/12, and 58.2% in London compared to the national average of 63.7% in 2012\/13. This a difference of 5.6 and 5.5 percentage points, respectively. Evidence suggests that there is a 'London effect' experienced in health care where people in London are in general less satisfied with their health care compared to the rest of England. Research suggests this could be due to a younger, more transient and more ethnically diverse population in London[1-4]. This effect could be used to explain the similar results we see here in social care service satisfaction.
