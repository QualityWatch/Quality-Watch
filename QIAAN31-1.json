"analysis_commentary" : "<P>The ratio of women who had their first appointment before 12 weeks and six days has generally increased over time from quarter 1 2010/11  (0.85)  to quarter 4 2011/12 (0.95). There also appears to be an annual pattern in the data where the ratios in quarter 1 are lower than the other quarters of the same year. Quarter 1 corresponds to antenatal appointments in April to June and maternities in October to December of the same year, we explore this relationship more in the next graph. </P>",
