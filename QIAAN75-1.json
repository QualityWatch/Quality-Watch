"analysis_commentary" : "<P>Overall, the percentage of staff who say they experienced physical violence from patients/relatives in the past 12 months is very low and ranges from 11 % in 2007 to 7% in 2011. It did increase to around 15% in 2012, but it is worth noting that over the years the key finding is not directly comparable, as the question has changed and the way in which staff could respond in 2012 made the responses more sensitive. The columns in a lighter shade represent responses from staff in mental health and learning disability trusts only. This follow the same broad pattern as the national response, but at a much higher response (at least double between 2007 and 2011).</P>",
