We therefore also looked at the proportion of admissions in a local authority that occurred over 20 km from a patient’s home.</p><p>For the majority of local authorities (67% in 2011/12), at least 90% of the emergency admissions occurred within 20 km. But there are some local authorities (13 in 2011/12) for which over 70% of the emergency admissions occurred over 20 km from home. However, these are all rural areas, with relatively lower populations.</p>",
